BOOK 1


CHAPTER 1
On Human Action


1. Duty is here defined by me as man's action, duly conformed to the ordinances of the law, and in
proportion to obligation. To understand this, it is necessary to treat first of the nature of human
action, and also of laws in general.

2. By human action we understand not any motion proceeding from the faculties of man, but that
motion only which proceeds from and is directed by those faculties which the Creator has given to
mankind above the brutes, -- I mean that which is undertaken with intellect lighting the way, and
at the bidding of the will.

3. Man has in fact been granted the power not only of knowing the different things which he meets
in this universe, of comparing them and of forming new notions in regard to them, but also the
ability to foresee what he is going to do, to bestir himself to accomplish it, to shape it to a certain
norm and a certain end, and to infer what the result will be; and further, to judge whether things
already done conform to rule. Moreover, not all the faculties of man act continually or in a uniform
manner. Some of them, in fact, are excited, and then controlled and directed, by an impulse from
within. Finally a man is not attracted to all objects indifferently, but seeks some and shuns others.
Often too, though the object be present, he checks the impulse, and when several objects are before
him, he selects one and rejects the others.

4. With regard then to the faculty of comprehending and judging things -- intellect it is called -- we
must hold it absolutely certain that any man of mature age and sound mind has enough of natural
light to be able, with training and due reflection, to comprehend properly at least those general
precepts and principles which make for an honorable and a peaceful life in this world; also to
appreciate the fact that they are in conformity with human nature. For if this be not admitted, at least
within the competence of the human court, men would be able to shield any misdeeds of theirs by
an invincible ignorance, since in the human court no one can be accused of violating a rule which
it is beyond his powers to comprehend.

5. When a man's intellect has been well instructed as to what is to be done or left undone, to the
point of understanding how to give certain and unmistakable reasons for its opinion, we call this a
right conscience. But when a man has indeed a correct opinion as regards doing and leaving undone,
without the ability to establish the same by argument, having acquired it from the general tenor of
life in a community, from habit, or from the authority of superiors, and having no reason impelling
him to the opposite course, we call this a probable conscience. By this the greater part of men are
guided, for it has been given to few to discover the causes of things.

6. To some, however, it happens not infrequently, especially in regard to particular cases, that
arguments for both sides suggest themselves, and they lack the strength of judgment to see clearly
which have greater weight. This is usually called a doubtful conscience. And here is the rule for it:
So long as judgment is uncertain as to what is good, or what bad, action must be suspended. For
while the doubt is unremoved, the decision to act involves an intention to do wrong, or at least
neglect of the law.

7. Often too the human intellect mistakes the false for the true, and then is said to be in error. And
error is usually called vincible, when a man with attention and due care can avoid falling into it; but
invincible, when even by employing all the diligence which the circumstances of the common life
require, one could not avoid the error. This sort, however, at least among those whose heart's desire
it is to nurture the light of reason and order their lives in accordance with honor, does not usually
happen in regard to the general precepts for living, but merely in connection with particular matters.
For the general precepts of the natural law are clear; and then he who makes positive laws follows
the custom and the duty of taking special pains that they be made known to his subjects. Hence,
without supine neglect, this error does not arise. But in particular matters it is easy for error in regard
to the object and other circumstances of the action to steal in against a man's will and without his
fault.

8. But where there is simply an absence of knowledge, this is called ignorance. And the latter is
treated in two ways, first, according as it contributes to the action; second, according as it comes
about against the will, or not without blame. From the former point of view ignorance is usually
divided into the effectual and the concomitant. In the absence of the former the action in question
would not have been undertaken. The latter may have been absent, and still the action would have
been undertaken. From the second point of view ignorance is voluntary or involuntary. The former
is even knowingly affected, the means of arriving at the truth having been rejected; or, failing to
employ due diligence, one has allowed it to steal in unawares. The involuntary ignorance is when
one does not know what he could not know, and was not bound to know. And this again is twofold.
For either a man was unable, indeed, to avoid ignorance for the present, and yet was to blame for
being in that state; or else he was not only unable to conquer his ignorance for the present, but is also
not to blame for having fallen into such a condition.

9. The second faculty which is exclusively seen in man, as compared with the brutes, is called the
will. By means of this, as from some inward impulse, a man bestirs himself to action, and chooses
what especially attracts him, rejects what does not seem to him suitable. From the will, therefore,
man derives the power of acting of his own accord, in other words, the fact that he is not set to act
by some inward necessity, but is himself the author of his own action; also the power of acting
freely, which means that, when one object is put before him, he can act or not act, and choose the
same, or reject it, or if several objects are set before him, can select one and reject the rest. Moreover
some human actions are undertaken on their own account, some in so far as they serve to gain
another object, that is, some have the functions of an end and others of means. Hence as regards an
end, the concern of the will is first to recognize and approve it, then to bestir itself effectually to gain
it, with more or less earnestness of aim; then having attained, to rest in quiet enjoyment of it. As for
means, they are first approved, then the most suitable, as it appears, selected, and finally put into
practice.

10. And just as the chief reason for considering a man responsible for his own acts is that he
undertook them of his own will, so we must especially observe that the freedom of the will is by all
means to be asserted, at least in regard to the acts for which a man is commonly held to account
before a human court. But where no freedom at all is left a man, there he will not himself be held
responsible for an act to which he unwillingly lends his limbs and powers, but the other man, who
brings constraint to bear.

11. Furthermore, although the will always chooses a generic good, and avoids a generic evil, still,
as between individuals, we see a great diversity of desires and actions. And the cause is the fart that
not all good and bad things appear to a man uncontaminated, but mixed together, good with bad, bad
with good. And because different objects affect peculiarly different parts, so to say, of the man, --
some, for example, his self-esteem, some his external senses, some his self-love, the instinct of
self-preservation, -- the result is that the man views these different objects as respectively becoming,
agreeable, and useful. And each of these makes the man incline especially toward itself, in exact
proportion to the strength of the impression it has made upon him. There is in most men a special
penchant also for certain things, and aversion to others. Consequently, in almost any action different
kinds of good things and bad, real or apparent, crop out together, and to distinguish these truly, some
men have more, some less, of penetration. It is no wonder then that one man is carried away to that
which is especially abhorrent to another.

12. Moreover, the will of man is not always found in equilibrium as regards any action, so that his
inclination to this or that side comes from his own inward impulse alone, after maturely weighing
everything. But most frequently the man is impelled in the one direction rather than in the other by
external influences. For, not to mention the common proclivity of human beings to the bad, the
origin and nature of which it is not for our court to examine, the will gains a special penchant from
a peculiarly constituted nature, by which some are much inclined to a certain kind of action. And
this is observed not only in individuals, but also in entire nations. It appears to be produced by the
character of the atmosphere all about us, and of the soil, also the combination of humors in the body.
resulting from birth itself, age, food, health, occupation, and similar causes; further by the
conformation of the organs, which the mind uses in performing its functions, and so on. Here we
must note that not only can a man with care repress and alter his temperament considerably; but also,
no matter how much force is attributed to the latter, it must not be thought to have such strength as
to force the man necessarily into violation of the natural law, in so far as it is enforced in the human
court, where base desires, stopping short of the outward act, are not considered. And, in fact, no
matter how much Nature, though driven out with a fork, still returns, a man can nevertheless prevent
her causing external acts that are immoral. And the difficulty encountered in conquering a bent of
that sort is balanced by the glory and praise which here awaits the victor. But should the mind be
goaded with passions such as no reason can hold in check, there is still a way of emptying them out,
as it were, without sin.

13. And then the will is strongly bent toward certain acts by frequent repetition of acts of the same
sort, from which arises a proclivity which we call habit. The result of habit is that an action is
undertaken willingly and lightly, so that the mind seems to be, as it were, dragged toward the object,
if present, or most ardently to desire it, if absent. And one should note that there is no habit such that
a man cannot with care throw it off again; and also none that can so far pervert the mind, that a man
is unequal to the task of restraining here and now the outward acts, at least, toward which habit is
swept. And as it is in a man's power to contract a habit of the kind, no matter how much it facilitates
the act, nothing is subtracted from the value of his good deeds, nor is the guilt of his misdeeds any
the less. In fact, as a good habit heightens a man's praise, so a bad habit his shame.

14. It also makes a great difference whether there is a calm tranquillity of mind, or whether it is
stirred by certain special emotions, which they call passions. With regard to these this must be our
opinion: however violent they may be, still by due use of reason a man can be superior to them and
check their attack, at least before the ultimate act. Moreover, some of the passions are excited by the
appearance of a good, others of an evil, and they spur us on to win some agreeable thing, or to avoid
the disagreeable. Consequently it is in keeping with human nature that more favor and indulgence
among men should go with the second class of passions, and precisely in proportion to the
intolerable violence of the evil which aroused them. It is in fact thought much more tolerable to
dispense with a good not very necessary to self-preservation, than to suffer an evil tending to the
destruction of our nature.

15. Finally, as there are certain diseases which quite take away the use of reason, permanently, or
for a time, so among many nations it is a common thing for men actually to invite a kind of malady
which soon passes away, and greatly disturbs the use of reason. By which hint I mean intoxication,
arising from some beverages and some kinds of smoke. It creates in the blood and spirit a violent
commotion, and gives men a proclivity to lust in particular, to anger, rashness, and excessive mirth,
so that many seem to be carried out of themselves by intoxication, and to have put on an entirely
different nature, as compared with their sober appearance. While it does not, however, always take
away the complete use of reason, as being self-invited, it is apt to win odium, rather than favor, for
the acts done in that condition.

16. Again, human actions are called voluntary, since they proceed from the will and are guided by
it. In the same way whatever actions are knowingly undertaken in opposition to the will, are called
involuntary, in the narrower sense of the term. For in its wider sense it also includes acts committed
through ignorance. But by involuntary I here mean the same thing as compelled, that is, when a man
is forced by a stronger principle from without to surrender the use of his limbs, in such wise as to
show his aversion and dissent by signs, and especially by bodily resistance. Also, but less exactly,
we speak of the involuntary, when under the stress of necessity one chooses as the lesser evil and
undertakes a thing to which formerly, when unconstrained by necessity, one was absolutely averse.
Such actions they commonly call mixed. With the voluntary they have this in common, that the will
does in the emergency choose the apparently lesser evil. With the involuntary they agree to a certain
extent in their effect, in that they are either not laid at all to the charge of the doer, or less severely
than are the voluntary actions.

17. But human actions proceeding from and guided by intellect and will possess this particular
attribute, that they can be imputed to a man, that is, that the man can rightly be regarded as their
author, and held to the rendering of an account of them, and that the consequences which flow from
them fall back upon himself. For there is no more intimate reason why an action can be imputed to
a man, than because, directly or indirectly, it proceeded from him, knowing and willing it; or
because it was in his power, whether the thing should be done or not. Hence in the moral sciences
which concern the human tribunal, it is accounted a fundamental axiom, that a man can be called
to account for those actions, the performance or omission of which was in his power; or, -- and this
amounts to the same thing, -- that any action which can be directed by a man, and brought about or
not at his discretion, can be laid at his own door. So too, on the other hand, no one can be reckoned
the author of an action which neither in itself nor in its cause was within his power.
18. Out of these premises we shall form a number of particular propositions, from which it will be
established what can be imputed to each man, that is, of what action and result each one can be
regarded as the author. First, the actions which another commits, as also the workings of any other
causes, and any effects, can only be imputed to a man in so far as he has the power and the duty to
control them. Nothing, in fact, is more common among men than for one man to be intrusted with
the direction of another's actions. In this case, then, if the other should commit any action in regard
to which the first omitted to do what was in his power, that action will be imputed not only to him
who immediately committed it, but also to him who neglected any part of the direction which was
his duty and within his power. This, however, has its limits and bounds, so that the possible in the
case is to be understood with a certain reservation and in a moral sense. By no subjection of one man
to another is the freedom of the subject so far extinguished that he cannot resist the direction of the
other, and have different aims, and, on the other hand, human life is not so constituted that a man
continually attached to one man should be able to observe his every movement. It follows then that,
if one has done everything which the nature of the direction laid upon him suggests, when,
nevertheless, something has been done by the other, it will be imputed to the doer alone. Thus since
men have assumed the ownership of animals, whatever has been done by them to the detriment of
another will be laid to the charge of the owner, if, indeed, he has omitted any due care and
watchfulness. Thus also any evils which befall another can be imputed to him who, having the power
and duty, did not remove their cause and occasion. So, since men have it in their power to promote
or suspend many natural operations, any advantage or loss, which they may have occasioned, will
be imputed to them in proportion to their contributory pains or neglect. Also in some extraordinary
cases a man is responsible for such events as are at other times beyond human control, since the
Deity has in a special manner brought them about with reference to a certain man. These and similar
cases aside, it is enough if a man can render account of his own actions.

19. Secondly, whatever qualities are found, or not found, in a man, when their presence or absence
was not within his power, cannot be imputed to the man himself, except in so far as he failed by
industry to make good his natural defect, or to second his native powers. Thus, since no one could
insure himself mental penetration and bodily strength, nothing will be chargeable to any one on that
account, save in so far as he availed himself of training, or failed to do so. Thus it is not the rustic,
but the man of the city and the court, to whom uncouth manners are made a reproach. Hence
fault-finding for qualities whose cause was not in our power is to be accounted very absurd, for
example, shortness of stature, imperfection of form, and the like.

20. Thirdly, things done through invincible ignorance cannot be laid to one's charge. For we cannot
direct an action when the light of intellect does not shine before us; and also we arc presupposing
that the man was unable to gain such a light, and was not to blame for this inability. Indeed, in
common life ability is understood, in a moral sense, to be that degree of capacity, shrewdness, and
caution, which is usually judged sufficient, and was based upon plausible reasons.

21. Fourthly, ignorance, as also error, in regard to laws and the duty imposed upon each man does
not release one from responsibility. For he who imposes laws and duty upon a man is accustomed,
and is bound, to bring these to the notice of the subject. And laws and rules of duty are usually
adapted, and must be so, to the capacity of the subject; and to learn and remember them must be a
care to everyone. Hence he who is the cause of others' ignorance will be held answerable for the acts
also which flow from that ignorance.

22. Fifthly, if a man lacks opportunity to act without involving himself in a fault, his failure to act
will not be laid to his account. And opportunity seems to include these four points: (1) that the object
of the act be at hand, (2) that there be a convenient place, where we cannot be hindered by others,
or suffer some harm, (3) that there be a favorable time, when we do not have more necessary
business to transact, -- a time which is favorable for others also who concur in the act, (4) finally that
we have the natural powers for the act. Without these circumstances the action could not take place,
and hence it would be absurd to hold a man accountable, when the opportunity to act was lacking.
Thus a physician cannot be accused of indolence, if no one is ill; and a man who is himself in want
is not permitted to be liberal. So also he cannot be charged with hiding his talent, who has been
refused the position for which he made a proper request. And "unto whomsoever much is given, of
him shall be much required." Thus we cannot suck and blow at the same time.

23. Sixthly, it cannot be laid to a man's account either, that he did not do things which exceed his
powers, and cannot be prevented by these, or brought about by them. Hence the common saying that
there is no obligation for the impossible. We must, however, add the proviso that a man has not
diminished or lost his power to perform by his own fault. For such a man can be treated just as if he
still retained his powers; for otherwise there would be an easy way to evade any rather troublesome
obligation, by electing to destroy the power to perform.

24. Seventhly, there is also no responsibility for what one suffers or does under compulsion. For to
avert or escape such things is understood to be beyond the man's powers. Now compulsion is used
in two senses: first, when a stronger by force employs our limbs to do or suffer something; secondly,
if a more powerful person threatens some great harm at once, and has the ability to carry it out
directly, unless we are ready to bestir ourselves to do something, or to refrain from action. For in
that case, unless we are expressly obliged to buy off at our own cost the injury we were to inflict
upon a third party, the man who imposes upon us that necessity will be considered the author of the
crime; but the deed can no more be imputed to us than bloodshed to the sword or the ax.

25. Eighthly, those who are deprived of the use of their reason are not accountable for their actions.
For they are unable to distinguish clearly what is being done, or to compare it with a standard. Here
belong the acts of infants, before the reason begins to show itself at all dearly. As for the fact that
they are scolded or whipped for certain acts, it is not done with the idea that they have strictly
speaking deserved punishment in the human court; but it is by way of mere correction and discipline,
that they may not make trouble for others by such actions, or may not form a bad habit. So, too, the
acts of the insane, the unbalanced and dotards, if the disease has come without their fault, are not
regarded as human actions.

26. Ninthly, and finally, one is not accountable for what he imagines he does in sleep, except in so
far as by dwelling with pleasure upon the thought of such things by day he has deeply impressed
their images upon his mind. And yet these too are very rarely considered in a human court. For in
general imagination in sleep is like a boat adrift without a pilot, so that it is not in a man's power to
determine what kind of images fancy is to produce.

27. With regard to responsibility for the acts of another, we should observe more closely that
sometimes, to be sure, it happens that an action is not laid at all to the charge of him who directly
committed it, but to another person who used him as a mere instrument. More commonly, however,
an act is charged both to him who committed it, and to him who concurred by some act or omission.
This happens especially in three ways: either the second party is accounted the principal cause of
the act and he who committed it secondary; or they both walk pari passu; or the second party is the
secondary cause, and he who committed it the principal. To the first class belong those who urged
another to anything by their influence; those who gave the necessary consent, without which the
other could not have acted; those who were able and bound to prevent, and did not do so. To the
second class belong those who charge another, or hire him, to commit crime; those who help, harbor,
or defend; those who, being able and bound to lend aid to the injured party, failed to do so. To the
third class are referred those who give particular advice; those who applaud and approve before the
deed; those who by their example inflame others to wrong-doing, and similar persons.


CHAPTER 2
On the Norm of Human Actions, or Law in General


1. Because human actions depend upon the will, but the wills of individuals are not always
consistent, and those of different men generally tend toward different things, therefore, in order to
establish order and seemliness among the human race, it was necessary that some norm should come
into being, to which actions might be conformed. For otherwise, if with such freedom of the will,
and such diversity of inclinations and tastes, each should do whatever came into his head, without
reference to a fixed norm, nothing but the greatest confusion could arise among men.

2. That norm is called law, that is, a decree by which a superior obliges a subject to conform his arts
to his own prescription.

3. That this definition may be better understood, we must develop the meaning of obligation, whence
it arises, who can undertake an obligation, and who impose it upon another. Obligation, then, is
commonly defined as a legal bond, by which we are of necessity bound to perform something. That
is, a kind of bridle is thereby put upon our freedom, so that, though in actual fact the will can have
a different aim, still it finds itself imbued with an inward sentiment due to the obligation, with the
result that, if the action performed is not in conformity with the prescribed norm, the will is forced
to acknowledge that it has not done what is right. And so if any ill should befall a man on that
account, he would judge that it befalls him not undeservedly; since by following the norm, as was
proper, he might have avoided it.

4. For the fart that man is fitted to undertake an obligation there are two reasons: one, because he
has a will which can turn in different directions, and so also conform to the rule; the other, since man
is not free from the power of a superior. For where an agent's powers have been bound by nature to
a uniform mode of action, there we look in vain for free action; and it is vain to prescribe a rule for
a man who cannot understand it nor conform to the same. Again, assuming that a man does not
recognize a superior, there is for that reason no one who can rightfully impose a necessity upon him.
And if he be ever so strict in observing a certain method of action, and consistently abstain from
certain arts, still he is understood to do this not from any obligation, but from his own good pleasure.
It follows then that he is capable of an obligation who not only has a superior, but also can recognize
a prescribed rule, and further has a will flexible in different directions, but conscious of the fart that,
when the rule has been prescribed by a superior, it does wrong to depart from the same. Such is
evidently the nature with which man is endowed.

5. Obligation is properly introduced into the mind of a man by a superior, that is, a person who has
not only the power to bring some harm at once upon those who resist, but also just grounds for his
claim that the freedom of our will should be limited at his discretion. For when these conditions are
found in anyone, he has only to intimate his wish, and there must arise in men's minds a fear that is
tempered with respect, the former in view of his power, the latter in consideration of the reasons,
which, were there no fear, must still induce one to embrace his will. For whoever is unable to assign
any other reason why he wishes to impose an obligation upon me against my will, except mere
power, can indeed frighten me into thinking it better for a time to obey him, to avoid a greater evil;
but, once that fear is removed, nothing further remains to prevent my acting according to my will
rather than his. Conversely, if he has indeed the reasons which make it my duty to obey him, but
lacks the power of inflicting any harm upon me, I may with impunity neglect his commands, unless
a more powerful person comes to assert the authority upon which I have trampled. Now the reasons
why one may rightly demand that another obey him are: in case some conspicuous benefits have
come to the latter from the former; or if it be proved that he wishes the other well, and is also better
able than the man himself to provide for him, and at the same time actually claims control over the
other; and finally if a man has willingly subjected himself to another and agreed to his control.

6. But that the law may exert its power in the minds of those for whom it is made, knowledge both
of the lawgiver and of the law itself is required. For no man will be able to yield obedience, if he
knows neither whom he ought to obey, nor to what he is obligated. And as for the lawgiver,
knowledge of him is very easy. For the natural laws, as the light of reason assures us, have the same
author as the universe. And the citizen cannot fail to know who has authority over him. How the
natural laws are made known, will be explained presently. Civil laws come to the knowledge of
subjects by public and explicit promulgation. In this two things must be dear: that the law has as its
author him who has the highest authority in the state; and also what is the meaning of the law. The
former point is established, if the sovereign shall promulgate the law by his own lips, or sign them
with his own hand, or if this be done by his ministers. The authority of the latter it is idle to question
if it is clear that this function is connected with the office which they fill in the state, and that they
are regularly employed for the same purpose; further if the laws in question are for the guidance of
the courts, and if they contain nothing derogatory to the sovereign authority. As for the meaning of
the law, that this may be rightly understood, it is incumbent upon those who promulgate them to use
the utmost clearness. Should any obscurity be found in the laws, an interpretation must be sought
from the lawgiver, or from those who are publicly ordained to render justice in accordance with the
laws.

7. Every perfect law has two parts: one defining what is to be done, or not done; the other indicating
what punishment is in store for him who neglects what is enjoined and does what is forbidden. For
on account of the depravity of human nature, prone as it is to the forbidden, it is superfluous to say
"Do this!" if there is no punishment in store for the non-doer. And it is equally absurd to say "You
will pay the penalty," if the reason which merits punishment has not preceded. Accordingly all the
force of a law consists in the declaration of what our superior wishes us to do or not do, and of the
penalty which has been fixed for transgressors of the law. But the power to oblige, that is, to impose
an inward necessity, and the power to force or compel by penalties to observe the law, resides
exclusively in the lawgiver, and in him to whom has been committed the maintenance and execution
of the laws.

8. Whatever is enjoined upon a man by the laws ought not only to be within his powers, for whom
they are made, but should also bring some advantage either to the man himself or to others. For as
it would be absurd and cruel to attempt-under threat of a penalty to exact from a man what is and
has always been beyond his powers, so it is idle to constrain the natural freedom of the will, if no
advantage for anybody be derived therefrom.

9. Moreover, although regularly a law embraces all the lawgiver's subjects to whom the content of
the law applies, and whom the lawgiver did not from the beginning wish exempt, it nevertheless
sometimes happens that a man is expressly released from the obligation of a law. And this is called
dispensation. But he only can dispense to whom belongs the power of enacting and abrogating a law;
and pains too must be taken that the authority of the laws be not undermined by promiscuous
dispensation granted without the weightiest reasons, and thus occasion be given for jealousy and
indignation among the subjects.

10. Very different from dispensation, however, is equity, a correction of a defect in the law due to
its universality, or a skillful interpretation of the law, showing by the natural reason that a particular
case is not included under the general law, since otherwise some absurdity would result. For because
it is impossible either to foresee or state all cases on account of their infinite variety, the judges,
whose task it is to apply general enactments of the laws to particular cases, are bound to except from
the law the kind of cases which the lawgiver would himself have excepted, were he present, or had
he foreseen such instances.

11. Again, from their relation to the moral standard and their agreement with it human actions gain
certain qualifying terms. As for the actions in regard to which the law ordains nothing in either
direction, they are called legitimate or permitted. Sometimes, to be sure, in the civil life, in which
not everything can be cut back to the quick, those acts also are called legitimate against which no
punishment has been ordained in the human court, though in themselves they are repugnant to
natural goodness. Also, actions in agreement with law are called good, if not in harmony therewith,
bad. But for an action to be good, it must in every way agree with the law; to be bad, it is enough
that it be defective at a single point.

12. Justice, however, is sometimes an attribute of actions, sometimes of persons. When justice is
attributed to a person, it is commonly defined as the "constant and perpetual will to render to every
man his due." For he who delights in doing just deeds, who is devoted to justice, who in everything
endeavors to do what is just, is called a just man. On the other hand the unjust is he who neglects
to give every man his due, or thinks the measure must be not that of his duty, but of present
advantage. Consequently not a few of the just man's acts may be unjust, and conversely. For the just
man acts justly on account of the precept of the law, but unjustly only through weakness, while the
unjust acts justly on account of the penalty annexed to the law, and unjustly from an evil character.

13. But when justice is predicated of actions, there is merely a proper application of these to the
person. And a just action is one which from deliberate choice, that is, by a knowing and willing
agent, is applied to the person to whom it is due. Hence the justice of acts differs from their
goodness especially in this, that the latter merely indicates conformity to law, while justice involves
in addition a regard for those toward whom the action goes out. For this reason justice is also defined
as virtue in relation to another.

14. On the division of justice there is no agreement. The generally received division is into universal
and particular. We speak of the former, when any duty whatever is practiced toward others, even that
which could not be exacted by force or by suit at law; of the latter, when a man receives just what
he could by rights demand. And this is again divided into distributive justice and commutative
justice. The former rests upon a compact entered into between a society and its members concerning
the pro rata sharing of profit and loss. The latter rests upon a bilateral contract in regard especially
to things and acts connected with trade.

15. Having learned what justice is, it is easy to conclude what injustice is. But here one must observe
that an unjust act, undertaken after premeditation, and violating what is by perfect right due another,
or what he possessed by the same right, -- no matter whence obtained, -- that act is properly called
an injury. And this happens in three ways: if one is refused a thing which he could by his own right
demand (not if something was due him out of mere humanity, or some such virtue); or if that is taken
away from him which he rightly held, by a title valid against the aggressor; or if we inflict upon
another some harm which we had not the right to inflict. For an injury, moreover, premeditation is
required, and malice on the part of the doer. Failing this, harming another is called an accident or
a fault, more or less serious, according to the seriousness of the thoughtlessness and neglect, in
consequence of which the encounter occurred.

16. With respect to its author, the law is divided into divine and human, the one enacted by God, the
other by men. But if law be considered according as it has a necessary and universal adaptation to
men or not, it is divided into the natural and the positive. The former is so adapted to the rational and
social nature of man, that an honorable and peaceful society cannot exist for mankind without it.
Consequently it can be investigated and learned as a whole, by the light of man's inborn reason and
a consideration of human nature. The latter kind of justice by no means flows from the common
condition of human nature, but proceeds from the decision of the lawgiver alone. And yet it ought
not to lack its own reason, and the utility which it effects for certain men or a particular society. But
while the divine law is now natural and now positive, human law is, in the strict sense, altogether
positive.


CHAPTER 3
On Natural Law


1. What is the character of the natural law, what its necessity, and of what precepts it consists in the
present state of mankind, are most clearly seen, after one has thoroughly examined the nature and
disposition of man. For, just as for an accurate knowledge of civil laws, it is very important to have
a clear understanding of the condition of the state, and of the habits and interests of its citizens, so
if we have examined the common disposition of men and their condition, it will be readily apparent
upon what laws their welfare depends.

2. Now man shares with all the animals that have consciousness the fact that he holds nothing dearer
than himself, and is eager in every way to preserve himself; that he strives to gain what seem to him
good things, and to reject the evil. This feeling is regularly so strong that all the others give way to
it. And one cannot but resent it, if any man make an attack upon one's life, so much so that, even
after the threatened danger has been averted, hatred usually still remains, and a desire for vengeance.

3. But in one respect man seems to be in a worse state even than the brutes, -- that scarcely any other
animal is attended from birth by such weakness. Hence it would be a miracle, if anyone reached
mature years, if he have not the aid of other men, since, as it is, among all the helps which have been
invented for human needs, careful training for a number of years is required, to enable a man to gain
his food and clothing by his own efforts. Let us imagine a man brought to maturity without any care
and training bestowed upon him by others, having no knowledge except what sprang up of itself in
his own mind, and in a desert, deprived of all help and society of other men. Certainly a more
miserable animal it will be hard to find. Speechless and naked, he has nothing left him but to pluck
herbs and roots, or gather wild fruits, to slake his thirst from spring or river, or the first marsh he
encountered, to seek shelter in a cave from the violence of the weather, or to cover his body
somehow with moss or grass, to pass his time most tediously in idleness, to shudder at any noise or
the encounter with another creature, finally to perish by hunger or cold or some wild beast. On the
other hand, whatever advantages now attend human life have flowed entirely from the mutual help
of men. It follows that, after God, there is nothing in this world from which greater advantage can
come to man than from man himself.

4. Yet this animal, though so useful to his kind, suffers from not a few faults, and is endowed with
no less power to injure; which facts make contact with him rather uncertain, and call for great
caution, that one may not receive evil from him instead of good. First of all, there is generally a
greater tendency to injure found in man than in any of the brutes. For the brutes are usually excited
by the desire for food and for love, both of which, however, they can themselves easily satisfy. But
having stilled that craving, they are not readily roused to anger or to injure people, unless someone
provokes them. But man is an animal at no time disinclined to lust, and by its goad he is excited
much more frequently than would seem necessary for the conservation of the race. And his belly
desires not merely to be satisfied, but also to be tickled, and often craves more than nature is able
to digest. That the brutes should not need clothing nature has provided. But man delights to clothe
himself, not for necessity only, but also for display. Many more passions and desires unknown to
the brutes are found in man, as the desire to have superfluities, avarice, the love of glory and
eminence, envy, emulation, and rivalry of wits. Witness the fact that most wars, in which men clash
with men, are waged for reasons unknown to the brutes. And all these things can, and usually do,
incite men to desire to injure one another. Then too there is in many a notable insolence and passion
for insulting their fellows, at which the rest, modest though they be by nature, cannot fail to take
offense, and gird themselves to resist, from the desire to maintain and defend themselves and their
freedom. At times also men are driven to mutual injury by want, and the fact that their present
resources are insufficient for their desires or their need.

5. Moreover men have in them great power for the infliction of mutual injuries. For though not
formidable because of teeth or claws or horns, as are many of the brutes, still manual dexterity can
prove a most effective means of injury; and shrewdness gives a man the opportunity to attack by
cunning and in ambush, where the enemy cannot be reached by open force. Hence it is very easy for
man to inflict upon man the worst of natural evils, namely death.

6. Finally, we must also consider in mankind such a remarkable variety of gifts as is not observed
in single species of animals, which, in fact, generally have like inclinations, and are led by the same
passion and desire. But among men there are as many emotions as there are heads, and each has his
own idea of the attractive. Nor are all stirred by a single and uniform desire, but by one that is
manifold and variously intermixed. Even one and the same man often appears unlike himself, and
if he has eagerly sought a thing at one time, at another he is very averse to it. And there is no less
variety in the tastes and habits, the inclinations to exert mental powers, -- a variety which we see
now in the almost countless modes of life. That men may not thus be brought into collision, there
is need of careful regulation and control.

7. Thus then man is indeed an animal most bent upon self-preservation, helpless in himself, unable
to save himself without the aid of his fellows, highly adapted to promote mutual interests; but on the
other hand no less malicious, insolent, and easily provoked, also as able as he is prone to inflict
injury upon another. Whence it follows that, in order to be safe, he must be sociable, that is, must
be united with men like himself, and so conduct himself toward them that they may have no good
cause to injure him, but rather may be ready to maintain and promote his interests.

8. The laws then of this sociability, or those which teach how a man should conduct himself, to
become a good member of human society, are called natural laws.

9. So much settled, it is clear that the fundamental natural law is this: that every man must cherish
and maintain sociability, so far as in him lies. From this it follows that, as he who wishes an end,
wishes also the means, without which the end cannot be obtained, all things which necessarily and
universally make for that sociability are understood to be ordained by natural law, and all that
confuse or destroy it forbidden. The remaining precepts are mere corollaries, so to speak, under this
general law, and the natural light given to mankind declares that they are evident.

10. Again, although those precepts have manifest utility, still, if they are to have the force of law,
it is necessary to presuppose that God exists, and by His providence rules all things; also that He has
enjoined upon the human race that they observe those dictates of the reason, as laws promulgated
by Himself by means of our natural light. For otherwise they might, to be sure, be observed perhaps,
in view of their utility, like the prescriptions of physicians for the regimen of health, but not as laws;
since these of necessity presuppose a superior, and in fact one who has actually undertaken the
direction of another.

11. But that God is the author of the natural law, is proved by the natural reason, if only we limit
ourselves strictly to the present condition of humanity, disregarding the question whether his
primitive condition was different from the present, or whence that change has come about. The
nature of man is so constituted that the race cannot be preserved without the social life, and man's
mind is found to be capable of all the notions which serve that end. And it is in fact clear, not only
that the human race owes its origin, as do the other creatures, to God, but also that, whatever be its
present state, God includes the race in the government of His providence. It follows from these
arguments that God wills that man use for the conservation of his own nature those special powers
which he knows are peculiarly his own, as compared with the brutes, and thus that man's life be
distinguished from the lawless life of the brutes. And as this cannot be secured except by observing
the natural law, we understand too that man has been obliged by God to keep the same, as a means
not devised by will of man, and changeable at their discretion, but expressly ordained by God
Himself, in order to insure this end. For whoever binds a man to an end, is considered to have bound
him also to employ the means necessary to that end. And besides, we have evidence that the social
life has been enjoined upon men by God's authority, in the fact that in no other creature do we find
the religious sentiment or fear of the Deity, -- a feeling which seems inconceivable in a lawless
animal. Hence in the minds of men not entirely corrupt a very delicate sense is born, which
convinces them that by sin against the natural law they offend Him who holds sway over the minds
of men, and is to be feared even when the fear of men does not impend.

12. The common saying that that law is known by nature, should not be understood, it seems, as
though actual and distinct propositions concerning things to be done or to be avoided were inherent
in men's minds at the hour of their birth. But it means in part that the law can be investigated by the
light of reason, in part that at least the common and important provisions of the natural law are so
plain and clear that they at once find assent, and grow up in our minds, so that they can never again
be destroyed, no matter how the impious man, in order to still the twinges of conscience, may
endeavor to blot out the consciousness of those precepts. For this reason in Scripture too the law is
said to be "written in the hearts" of men. Hence, since we are imbued from childhood with a
consciousness of those maxims, in accordance with our social training, and cannot remember the
time when we first imbibed them, we think of this knowledge exactly as if we had had it already at
birth. Everyone has the same experience with his mother tongue.

13. Of the duties incumbent upon man in accordance with natural law the most convenient division
seems to be according to the objects in regard to which they are to be practiced. From this standpoint
they are classified under three main heads: the first of which instructs us how, according to the
dictate of sound reason alone a man should conduct himself toward God, the second, how toward
himself, the third, how toward other men. Although those precepts of natural law which concern
other men may be derived primarily and directly from sociability, which we have laid down as a
foundation, indirectly also the duties of man to God as creator can be derived from the same, since
the ultimate confirmation of duties toward other men comes from religion and fear of the Deity, so
that man would not be sociable either, if not imbued with religion; and since reason alone cannot
go further in religion than in so far as the latter subserves the promotion of peace and sociability in
this life. For, in so far as religion promotes the salvation of souls, it proceeds from a special divine
revelation. But duties of man to himself spring from religion and sociability conjointly. For the
reason why he cannot determine certain acts concerning himself in accordance with his own free
will, is partly that he may be a fit worshiper of the Deity, and partly that he may be a good and
useful member of human society.


CHAPTER 4
On the Duty of Man toward God, or Natural Religion


1. The duty of man toward God, so far as it can be investigated by the natural reason, reduces itself
to two heads: that we have right views of God, and secondly that we order our acts in conformity
with His will. Hence natural religion consists of propositions both theoretical and practical.

2. Among the views which every man must hold of God, he should first of all be persuaded that He
exists, that is, that there really is some highest and first Being, upon whom this universe depends.
The philosophers have most clearly demonstrated this by the subordination of causes, which demand
their ultimate resting in a First; also by motion and by contemplation of the machinery of the
universe, and similar arguments. And if any man shall deny that he can understand these, he does
not on that account find excuse for his atheism. For as the whole human race has been in perpetual
possession of that belief, it would be necessary, if anyone wished to attack it, not only to destroy
utterly all the arguments by which the existence of God is proved, but also to produce more plausible
reasons for his assertion. Likewise since it has been hitherto believed that the welfare of the human
race depends upon that conviction, the man would have further to show that the race is better served
by atheism than by retaining a sane cult of the Deity. This being impossible, the impiety of those
who venture to attack that belief in any way is detestable and to be most severely punished.

3. The second truth is that God is founder of this universe. For since reason makes it clear that all
those things did not exist of themselves, it must be that they have some first cause. And this is just
what we call God. Consequently they are deceived who from time to time noisily talk of Nature as
the ultimate cause of all things and all effects. For if by that term we understand that power of
effecting and acting which is seen in things, that in itself certainly is an argument for its author,
namely God: so impossible is it for Nature's power to enable us to deny God. If however by Nature
is meant the ultimate cause of everything, it is a kind of profane fastidiousness to avoid the plain and
received term, God. They too are in error who believe that God is some one of the things which
impinge upon our senses, and especially the stars. For their very substance declares that all of these
are no first thing, but sprung from another. Not less unworthy is their view of God who call Him the
soul of the world. For whatever the soul of the world may be, it denotes a part of the world, and how
could part of a thing have been its cause, that is, an antecedent? But if by soul of the world we mean
that first invisible being upon which depends the force and morion of all things, then in place of a
clear term we are substituting one that is obscure and figurative. Hence also it is evident that the
world is not eternal; for that is incompatible with the nature of that which has a cause. And he who
asserts the eternity of the world, denies it any possible cause, and thus denies God Himself.

4. The third maxim is that God rules over the whole world, and over the human race. This is
perfectly clear from the wonderful and constant order seen in this universe. But so far as the moral
effect is concerned, it is immaterial whether one denies that God exists, or that he governs the affairs
of men, since either view completely destroys all religion. For it is vain to fear or venerate him who,
though in himself preeminent, is not touched by any care for us, and will not, or cannot, bring us any
good or ill.

5. The fourth principle is that no attribute involving any imperfection applies to God. For as He is
the cause and origin of all things, it would be absurd for some creature of His to have the power to
conceive of a perfection which God lacked. More than that, His perfection being infinitely beyond
the capacity of so petty a creature, it will be proper to express it in negative rather than in positive
terms. Hence we must by no means apply to God those terms which connote something finite or
determinate, since the finite can always be matched by a greater. And every determination and figure
involves boundaries and a delimitation. In fact we are not to say that He is distinctly and plainly
comprehended or conceived by our imagination, or any other faculty of our soul, since whatever we
are able to conceive distinctly and fully, is finite. Nor do we hold in mind a complete concept of
God, because we call Him infinite, inasmuch as infinite does not properly denote anything in the
thing itself, but powerlessness in our mind, just as if we should say that we do not understand the
magnitude of His being. Hence one cannot say either that God has parts, or is a whole, since these
are the attributes of the finite; nor that He is contained in some place, for this implies bounds and
limits to His greatness; nor that He moves, or is at rest, for both of these suppose being in a place.
So also we cannot properly attribute to God anything which indicates a pain or a passion, for
instance anger, repentance, pity. I say properly, for where we read of such attributes of God, it stands
for the effect, in terms of man's feelings, not for the passion itself. The same is true of all that
indicates the need and absence of some good thing, for example, craving, hope, concupiscence,
sensual love. For these involve want, and so imperfection, since we could not understand craving,
hoping, and desiring, except in relation to things one needs or lacks. So too when one ascribes to
God intellect, will, knowledge, and acts of sense, as seeing or hearing, these are to be understood
as on a far higher plane than are the same things in ourselves. For will is the appetite of the reason;
but an appetite presupposes absence and need of the corresponding thing. And intellect and
sensation in man involve passion, impressed by objects upon the organs of the body and the powers
of the soul; which is a proof of a power dependent upon another, and hence not the most perfect.
Finally this also is inconsistent with divine perfection, to say that there are more gods than one. For
aside from the fact that the marvelous harmony of the world proves that it has but a single ruler, God
would also be limited, if there were several of equal power, not dependent upon Himself. Just so the
existence of a number of infinites would involve a contradiction. Such being the case, it is most in
harmony with reason, in expressing as best we may the attributes of God, to use words that are either
negative, as infinite, incomprehensible, immense, eternal, viz., lacking end and beginning; or
superlative, as best, greatest, most powerful, wisest, etc.; or else indefinite, as good, just, Creator,
King, Lord, etc., with the understanding that we wish not so much to tell distinctly what He is, as
to declare our wonder and obedience by some sort of an expression. And this is the sign of a mind
that is humble, and honors to the best of its ability.

6. The practical propositions of natural religion have to do partly with the internal and partly with
the external cult of God. The inward cult of God consists in honoring Him. And honor is the idea
one has of another's power and goodness combined. On considering God's power and goodness, man
must naturally conceive the utmost possible veneration of Him. Whence flows the obligation to love
Him, as the author and giver of every good; to hope in Him, upon whom we believe that all our
happiness, for the future too, depends; to rest content with His will, who in His goodness does all
things well, and gives us what is most expedient for us; to fear Him, as most powerful, to offend
whom is to incur the greatest punishment; finally in all things most humbly to obey Him, as Creator,
Lord, and best and greatest Ruler.

7. The external cult of God consists especially in these things: returning thanks to God for so many
blessings received from Him; expressing His will in one's acts, so far as possible, in other words,
obeying Him; admiring and celebrating His greatness; offering prayers to Him, to obtain blessings
and avert evils, since prayers are signs of hope, and hope the recognition of divine goodness and
power. Further, swearing, if the occasion arises, by God alone, and observing one's oath most
religiously, since this is required by God's omniscience and power. Also speaking of God with
reserve, since that is a sign of fear, and fear a confession of power. It follows that we must not use
the name of God rashly and in vain, both of which are unreserved; and that we must not swear where
there is no need, as that is to no purpose; also that we should not argue curiously and impertinently
in regard to the nature and government of God, for the only inference is that we wish to measure
God by the standard of our reason. Another taking care that whatever is rendered to God be the best
of its kind, and fitted to express the honor paid Him; another, worshiping God not only in private,
but also openly and publicly in the sight of men. For concealing an act is as it were blushing to do
it. On the other hand the public cult, besides testifying to our devotion, encourages others by our
example. Finally, one should use every effort to keep the natural laws. For as holding God's
authority in low esteem is worse than any insult, so conversely obedience is more acceptable than
any sacrifice.

8. So much is indeed certain, that the effect of this natural religion, precisely considered, and with
regard to man's present condition, is limited to the sphere of this life, and is of no avail to secure
eternal salvation. For human reason, if left to itself, does not know that the depravity which is seen
in man's faculties and inclinations came through human sin, and deserves the anger of God and
eternal destruction. Hence too the necessity of a Saviour is hidden from the reason, as also His
service and merit, likewise the promises of God, given to the human race, and whatever else depends
upon these, -- the things through which alone eternal salvation is gained for men, as is known from
the Scriptures.

9. Moreover it will be worth while to estimate a little more clearly the advantage which religion
contributes to human life, that we may establish the fact that it is in truth the ultimate and strongest
bond of human society. For in the natural liberty, if you take away the fear of the Deity, as soon as
a man has confidence in his own powers, he will at his own caprice undertake anything against the
weaker, and will consider honor, shame, good faith, as empty words; and will not be forced to do
right except by a sense of his own weakness. Again, remove religion, and the internal stability of
states would always be uncertain, and fear of temporal punishment, a promise given to superiors,
the glory to be gained by keeping the same, gratitude because men have been rescued from the
miseries of the natural state by the help of the government, -- none of these would suffice to hold
citizens to their duty. For to that situation we could in truth apply the saying: "He who knows how
to die, can never be forced." For those who fear not God can fear nothing more than death. If one
should have the hardihood to despise the latter, he could attempt anything against the rulers. And
a reason for such a desire would scarcely be lacking; for example, in order to avoid the
inconveniences which seem to fall upon one from the rule of another; or to gain for one's self those
advantages which attend the possessor of powers; especially since one may easily think he is right
in doing so, either because the man now in power seems to misgovern the state, or because the other
hopes he will himself rule far better. And then an opportunity for such attempts might easily present
itself, when the king fails to hedge his life about with sufficient caution (and in such a situation "who
is to guard the guards themselves?") ; or when many conspire, or when in the midst of a foreign war
enemies are made accomplices. Furthermore, citizens would be very prone to injure each other. For,
as in the civil court judgment is rendered according to acts and things proved, all crimes and
outrages from which profit is likely to be derived, would be regarded as cleverness, to be viewed
with complaisance, if they could be done in secret and without witnesses. Also no one would do the
works of pity or of friendship, except with the assurance of fame or emolument. Another
consequence would be that, so long as no one could place any firm confidence in the integrity of
another, were the divine punishments removed, individuals would live a life of perpetual anxiety and
suspicion, fearing to be deceived or injured by others. Moreover rulers as well as subjects would be
little inclined to do noble and glorious acts. For the rulers, fettered by no bonds of conscience, would
treat all offices and Justice herself as venal, and seek in all things their personal advantage, involving
the oppression of the citizens. They would also fear a rebellion on the part of the latter, and would
accordingly understand their own safety to depend entirely upon weakening them as far as possible.
Conversely, the citizens, fearing oppression from their rulers, would be always casting about for an
opportunity to rebel, and yet would be no less mutually distrustful and fearful of each other. Even
husbands and wives, if a trifling quarrel occurred, would mutually suspect that they were to be killed
by poison, or some other secret method. An equal danger from one's household would impend. For
since, without religion, there would also be no conscience, it would be difficult to detect such
crimes, as these are usually disclosed through a restless conscience, and the terror which is revealed
in external signs. Hence it is clear how much it is to the advantage of the human race to block all the
ways of atheism, that it may not grow strong; also how great madness pursues those who assert that
it is of service in winning a reputation for civic wisdom, if they appear inclined to impiety.


CHAPTER 5
On the Duty of Man toward Himself


1. Although a deeply implanted self-love constrains a man to exercise anxious care of self, and to
take thought in every way for his own interests, so that it would seem superfluous to invent any
obligation in this respect, still in another way man is obliged in any case to observe certain things
concerning himself. For man was not born for himself alone, but equipped with such remarkable
endowments by the Creator, that he may glorify Him, and become a fit member of human society.
Consequently he is bound so to order himself that he do not suffer the Creator's gifts to perish from
neglect, and that he contribute his due share to human society. Thus, although lack of education is
a reproach and a loss chiefly to one's self, the master does well to chastise his pupil, if he neglects
to learn arts of which he was capable.

2. Again, man consists of two parts, soul and body, of which the one performs the function of a ruler,
the other that of a servant or instrument, so that we use the authority of the mind, the servitude of
the body. Hence both must indeed be cared for, but especially the former. And the mind must first
of all be molded fitly to endure the social life, and imbued with a sense and a love of duty and honor.
Then, in accordance with the capacity and station of the individual, something more must be learned,
that a man may not be a useless cumberer of the ground, of no profit to himself, an annoyance to
others. Moreover, one must in due time choose an honorable calling in life, according to the
prompting of one's bent, or as determined by bodily and mental ability, birth, fortune, parental
authority, command of the civil authorities, opportunity, or necessity.

3. Furthermore, since the mind is upheld by the body, the powers of the latter must therefore be
strengthened and conserved by suitable food and labors, and not injured by intemperance in eating
and drinking, untimely and unnecessary labor, or any other means. Hence one must avoid gluttony,
drunkenness, excess in love, and the like. And since disordered and violent passions are not only an
incentive to disturb society, but also greatly injure the man himself, one must consequently take
pains to restrain one's passions so far as possible. And because many dangers can be repelled, when
one faces them courageously, faintness of heart must be banished, and the mind steeled against the
fear of danger.

4. Besides, no man has given himself life, which must rather be accounted a gift of God. Hence it
is evident that man by no means has power over his own life, to such an extent that he may at his
own discretion cut it off; that, on the contrary, one must wait in any case, until one is called away
by Him who stationed us at this post. However, since a man can by his efforts serve others, and is
bound to do so, and since a certain kind of work, or a more intense labor, wastes his strength so
much as to bring old age and the end of life upon him more promptly than if he had lived a life of
ease, it seems in every way justifiable for him to choose what will probably cause a shorter life, in
order that he may lavish the benefit of his talent upon others. And again, as frequently the life of
many cannot be saved, unless in their behalf others expose themselves to the probable risk of death,
the legitimate ruler could enjoin upon a citizen under threat of gravest punishment, not to avoid such
a danger by flight. Even on one's own authority it will be permissible to run such risk, if only
weightier reasons do not hold us back, and there is hope that it will bring safety to others, and these
are worthy to be ransomed at such a price. For it would be foolish vainly to join company with
another who is to perish, or, being an extraordinary man, to meet death for a worthless one. For the
rest, however, natural law does not appear at all to enjoin that any man prefer the life of any other
to his own; but other things being equal, each man is permitted to be his own nearest neighbor. But
those who in weariness of the annoyances which commonly attend human life, or in protest against
misdeeds which would not have made human society ashamed of them, or in fear of pains which
might have been bravely endured, a helpful example for others; or those who with an empty display
of loyalty or courage throw away their own lives, -- all these are certainly to be thought sinners
against the natural law.

5. But frequently self-preservation, which a most sensitive instinct and reason commend to man,
seems to conflict with the precept of sociability; namely, when our safety is so endangered by
another that either we must suffer death or some serious disadvantage, or else the other must be
repelled to his hurt. Therefore we must now explain how far self-defense is to be tempered with
restraint. Now self-defense takes place either without injury to him who threatens evil to us (i.e.,
while we let him see that an attack upon us is a dubious or a fearsome thing), or with injury to him,
or even death. The former method is undoubtedly permissible and free from any guilt

6. As for the second method, however, scruple can arise, since the human race seems to suffer an
equal loss, whether my assailant is killed, or I myself perish; and because I must in any event destroy
an image of myself, with whom I am bound to maintain the social life; and, once more, because a
violent defense seems to cause a greater disturbance than if I either take to flight, or yield my body
submissively to my assailant. But all these arguments do not make this kind of defense at all illegal.
For in order that my conduct toward a man be peaceful and friendly, it is required that, in his attitude
toward me, he show himself a fit person to receive attentions from me. And since the law of
sociability looks to the safety of men, it must be so interpreted as not to destroy the safety of
individuals. Hence when another threatens me with death, there is no law which commands me to
betray my own safety, that another's malice may attack me with impunity. And whoever in such a
case is hurt or killed, has reason to blame his own perversity, which put upon me that necessity.
Otherwise, in fact, all the good things which nature or industry has gained for us would have been
given to us for nothing, if it were not permitted to offer violence to another who unjustly descends
upon them. And the good would be exposed as a ready prey to the bad, if they must never offer them
violence. Hence to proscribe utterly forcible self-defense, would be the destruction of the human
race.

7. Yet, when injury is threatened, one may not always fly to extreme measures; but the safer must
first be tried, for instance, allowing my assailant no access to me, shutting myself up behind walls,
warning him to desist from his madness. So too it is the part of prudence, to practice patience in a
slight injury, if it can conveniently be done, and to waive some of one's rights, rather than expose
one's self to a greater danger by untimely resistance to force, especially when the thing attacked is
one which can easily be repaired or made good. But when my safety cannot be secured by this or
any such method, it will be permissible to try even extreme measures to that end.

8. But to decide clearly whether a man has kept within the bounds of blameless defense, we have
first to consider whether he lives in natural freedom, not subject to any mortal, or on the other hand
is responsible to civil authority. In the former condition, when another insists upon inflicting an
injury, and is unwilling to be moved to repentance for his base attempt, and to be at peace with me
as before, then I shall be able to repel him even with bloodshed; and this not only if he attack my
life, but also if he attempt to wound or merely to hurt me, or even to steal, without injury of person.
For I have no security that he will not pass from these to greater injuries; and he who shows himself
a public enemy is protected by no further rights from being repelled by me in any way whatever.
And life would indeed be unsocial, if it were not permitted to employ extreme measures against him
who does not cease to pile up moderate injuries. For on that basis the most inoffensive would be the
perpetual mockery of the worst. Furthermore, in this condition of natural liberty, I cannot only repel
a danger threatened for the present, but also, that averted, I can pursue the assailant until I have
secured myself against him for the future. With regard to this security, we must hold that, if a man
after inflicting an injury is moved to spontaneous repentance, asks pardon, and offers compensation
for the loss, I am bound to accept his word and be reconciled to him. For to repent of one's own
motion and ask pardon, is a strong indication of a change of character. But if a man shows penitence
only when his powers of resistance fail, it seems unsafe to trust his bare promise. Therefore from
such a man the power to injure must be taken away, or some other bond must be imposed upon him,
that henceforth he may not be formidable to us.

9. On the other hand, those who are subjected to civil authority employ a forcible self-defense
lawfully only when time and place do not permit of imploring the aid of a magistrate in repelling
an injury by which life, or a blessing as valuable as life, or irreparable, is brought into immediate
danger. That the danger may be averted, I say, and that only, whereas vengeance and security against
future offense shall be left to the discretion of the magistrate.

10. Moreover I may undertake my defense as well against him who threatens my life with malice
aforethought, as against him who does so by mistake; for example, if a man assaults me while insane
or because he thought me another, with whom he has a quarrel. For it is enough that the other have
no right to attack or kill me, and there be on my side no obligation to die in vain.

11. As for the time within which defense is right and proper, this view is to be held: where both
parties live in natural liberty, even though they could presume, and ought to presume, that others
would observe toward them the duties of natural law, still, on account of the wickedness of human
nature, they are bound never to be so free from concern as not to surround themselves with timely
and legitimate defenses; for example, by blocking the approach of those who have hostile designs,
by getting together arms and men, by winning allies, by closely watching the attempts of the others,
and by like measures. But that suspicion, arising from the common wickedness of men, does not
suffice to enable me, under pretext of self-defense, actually to surprise my enemy by an armed
attack, not even if I see his power growing unduly, especially where he has increased it by harmless
industry, or by the favor of fortune, without oppressing others. More than that if a man show, besides
the ability also the wish to harm, and this not indeed against me, but against a third party, I cannot
for that reason at once venture to attack him on my own account, unless I am bound by an agreement
to aid the other, who is being unjustly attacked by a more powerful man. It is expedient to do this
all the more promptly, if it be probable that, after overpowering the other, he will turn to me also,
and will use his former victory as a means to the next. But where it is quite clear that the other is
already planning an attack upon me, even though he has not yet fully revealed his intentions, it will
be permitted at once to begin forcible self-defense, and to anticipate him who is preparing mischief,
provided there be no hope that, when admonished in a friendly spirit, he may put off his hostile
temper; or if such admonition be likely to injure our cause Hence he is to be regarded as the
aggressor, who first conceived the wish to injure, and prepared himself to carry it out. But the excuse
of self-defense will be his, who by quickness shall overpower his slower assailant. And for defense
it is not required that one receive the first blow, or merely avoid and parry those aimed at him.

12. But in states no such ample room is allowed for self-defense. For here, though one knows that
a citizen is preparing to attack him, or else scattering fierce threats, it will by no means be permitted
to anticipate him, but he must be reported to their common ruler, and security sought from the same.
But when a man is already being attacked by another, and reduced to such straits that there is no
opportunity to call for the aid of a magistrate or other citizens, then only will it be permitted to repel
violence by employing extreme measures against the assailant; not indeed with the intention of
exacting vengeance for the wrong by bloodshed, but because without such bloodshed life cannot be
rescued from immediate danger. Moreover, the beginning of the time within which one can kill
another in self-defense with impunity, is reckoned from the moment when the aggressor, manifesting
his wish to make an attack upon my life, and furnished with the bodily powers and the instruments
necessary to injure, is now on the spot from which he can actually injure me, reckoning also that
space which is needed, if I prefer to anticipate, rather than to be anticipated. And yet, on account of
the mental excitement which such danger occasions, exceeding the limits slightly is disregarded in
the human court. Further, the time of blameless self-defense lasts until the aggressor has been
repelled, or has of himself retired (whether because he was touched by penitence in the very moment
of his crime, or because his attempt met with no success), so that for the present he can no longer
injure, and we have the opportunity to withdraw to a place of safety. For vengeance for an assault,
and security for the future, concern the responsibility and power of the civil authority.

13. But although it has been said that it is not right to rush into bloodshed when the danger can be
repelled in a more convenient way, still on account of the excitement which imminent danger
commonly produces, it is not usual to be over-particular. For one in the flutter of such danger may
not be so careful in surveying all the ways of escape, as the man who is considering the subject with
a mind unperturbed. And then, just as it is rash to venture down from a safe place, to meet the
challenger, so, if he attacks me in an exposed situation, I am not expressly obliged to flee, except
perhaps when there is near by a refuge, to which I may betake myself without danger. And I am not
always obliged to retreat backwards. For then one must expose his back, and the danger of a fall is
both before and behind; and once you have been forced from your position, it is difficult to recover
it again. Moreover, one is not excluded from the privilege of self-defense by the fact that he has
gone abroad to attend to his business, whereas he would have been safe from all danger, if he had
remained at home. Yet the same privilege is not enjoyed by him who has been challenged by another
to a duel, and, upon presenting himself, is so hard put to it that, unless he run the other through, he
must himself perish. For since the laws forbid one to run into that danger, no account is made of it
to excuse bloodshed.

14. The same concession is made for the defense of members of the body, as for that of life.
Consequently he too is held innocent who has killed an assailant using force with the intention
perhaps of mutilating merely a member, or inflicting a serious wound. For we naturally shrink very
much from mutilation and a serious wound; and mutilation of a member, especially one of the
nobler, is at times appraised as nearly equal to loss of life itself. In fact one cannot tell in advance,
but death may be the result of mutilation or wound; and such long-suffering goes beyond the
common self-possession of men, -- a patience to which the laws do not regularly bind us, especially
in favor of a wicked man.

15. Further, what is conceded in defense of life, is also accounted permissible in behalf of chastity.
For no greater insult can be offered a respectable woman, than to attempt to take away against her
will that virtue whose preservation brings the highest esteem to her sex, and reduce her to the
necessity of rearing her offspring for a public enemy.

16. Again, the defense of property, at least among those who live in natural liberty, can go so far as
the death of the assailant, provided the possessions are not such as to be contemptible. For certainly
without possessions our life cannot he preserved, and he who attacks our possessions shows as
hostile a spirit as he who assaults our life. But in states, where stolen goods can be recovered by the
help of a magistrate, this is not regularly permitted, except in case the man who has come to steal
our goods cannot be brought to court. For this reason it is lawful to slay pirates and burglars.

17. So much for self-defense in the case of those who are assaulted by others without provocation.
But the aggressor can rightly defend himself, and in so doing injure the other a second time, if, after
he has been moved to repentance and has offered reparation and security against injury for the
future, the injured man in a harsh spirit rejects his offer and endeavors to avenge himself with his
own hand.

18. Finally self-preservation is so highly regarded, that, if it cannot be obtained otherwise, in very
many cases it is thought to exempt from the obligation of the general laws. On this account necessity
is said to know no law. Naturally, since a man is impelled with such ardor to self-preservation, it is
difficult to assume that so strong an obligation has been imposed upon him, that his own safety must
give way before it. For, though not only God, but also, if the seriousness of the matter requires, the
civil authority may be able to impose upon us so rigid an obligation that death should be suffered
rather than yield a hair's breadth therefrom, we do not always assume that the obligation of the laws
is so rigid. For those who have promulgated these, or have introduced certain institutions among
men, wishing of course thereby to promote the safety or advantage of men, are believed to have had
regularly before their eyes the condition also of human nature, and how impossible it is for man not
to avoid and avert whatever tends to his destruction. Hence regularly the laws, especially the
positive sort, and all human institutions, are considered to except the case of necessity, in other
words, not to oblige, when observance of them would be attended by an evil destructive of human
nature, or exceeding the common endurance of men; unless even the case of necessity was included,
either expressly, or on account of the nature of the affair. Therefore necessity does not indeed have
the effect of making it possible for the law to be directly violated and sin committed; but from the
benevolence of lawgivers, and also from a regard for human nature, it is presumed that the case of
necessity is not included under a law conceived in general terms. The matter must be made dear by
one or two examples.

19. Although otherwise a man has no right over his own members, to mutilate or destroy them at
discretion, he will however be permitted to cut off a member attacked by an incurable disease, that
the whole body may not perish, or that parts still sound may not be involved, or that the use of other
members may not be hampered by a useless appendage.

20. If in case of shipwreck more persons have leaped into a boat than it can carry, and the boat does
not belong to one man by a particular right, it seems that they must draw lots to see who shall be
thrown overboard. And if anyone shall refuse the hazard of the lot, he can be thrown into the water,
without casting his lot, as one who seeks the destruction of all.

21. If two fall into imminent danger of death, in which both must perish, it is permitted one of them,
in order to save himself, to do anything which may hasten the death of the other, who would perish
in any case. For example, if I, a skilled swimmer, had fallen into deep water with another who was
not, and he threw his arms about me and held me, and I had not the strength to carry him out of the
water with me, I could get rid of him by force, in order not to be drowned with him, even though I
could hold him up somehow for a short time. So in a shipwreck, when I have seized a plank that will
not hold two, if a man swimming up tries to throw himself on the same plank, and is likely to destroy
us both, I shall be able to push him off by any force. So when an enemy threatens instant death to
two fugitives, one can leave the other in danger for his life, by closing a gate behind himself, or by
throwing down a bridge, if both cannot be saved together.

22. Necessity also gives us the right to expose another indirectly to the danger of death or serious
injury, it being no purpose of ours to harm him, but only in the interest of self-preservation to
undertake an act from which harm probably can come to him; provided we prefer, however, to meet
the necessity of our case in any other way, and mitigate the injury itself so far as in us lies. Thus, if
a stronger pursues me, with designs upon my life, and somebody happens to meet me in a narrow
street, my necessary way of escape, if, though admonished, he does not give way, or the limitations
of time or space do not admit of his doing so, I shall have a right to knock him down, and continue
my flight over his fallen body, even though it may seem probable that he will be seriously hurt by
the blow. All this, unless I am bound to the man by special obligation, so that I ought actually to take
the risk for his sake. But if he who stands in the way of flight, is unable, though admonished, to get
out of the road, for example an infant or a lame man, it will be at least excusable, if one tries to leap
over him, rather than expose one's own body to the enemy by delaying. On the contrary, if a man
insolently and inhumanly blocks me, and refuses to make way for me in my flight, he can even be
directly pushed and thrown down.
For the rest, those who suffer injury in such cases ought to bear the misfortune as their destiny.

23. If a man, without fault of his own, is in extreme want of food and clothing necessary against the
cold, and has been unable, by prayers, or purchase, or offer of service, to prevail upon others, who
are richer and in abundance, to let him have those things willingly, he may without the charge of
theft or robbery take them away by force or secretly; especially if he shall have the intention of
paying their estimated value, when occasion shall offer. For the rich man ought, out of humanity,
to succor one placed in such straits. And although in general what is owed on the score of humanity
cannot be taken away forcibly, still extreme necessity has this effect, that such things can be claimed
no less than those due on the basis of a perfect obligation. It is, however, required that the poor man
first try every means to meet his necessities with the consent of the owner; also that the owner be
not in the same straits, or likely soon to be reduced to them. Further, there must be restitution,
especially when the fortunes of the other do not permit him to make any such free gift.

24. Finally the necessity which presides over our fortunes seems to bestow upon us the permission
to destroy the property of others; but with these restrictions: that the danger to our property must
have come about without our fault; that it cannot be removed in a more convenient way; that we do
not destroy a more valuable thing belonging to another, to save ours, being less precious; that we
make good the value, if indeed the thing would not otherwise have perished; or else we should share
in the loss, if the other's property would otherwise have perished along with ours, but now by its
sacrifice preserves ours. This principle of equity is usually followed by admiralty law. So too, when
a fire has broken out and is threatening my house, it will be permissible to tear down my neighbor's
house. provided those whose houses have been thus saved make good their neighbor's loss pro rata.


CHAPTER 6
On Mutual Duties, and First, That of Not Injuring Others


1. Next come the duties which a man must practice toward other men. Some of them spring from
the common obligation, by which the Creator willed that all men as such should be bound together.
But some flow from a definite institution, introduced or received by men, or from a certain
adventitious status of men. The first are to be practiced by every man toward every other; the second
only toward certain persons, a certain condition or status being assumed. Hence one may call the
former absolute duties, the latter conditional.

2. Among the absolute duties, i.e., of anybody to anybody, the first place belongs to this one: let no
one injure another. For this is the broadest of all duties, embracing all men as such. It is also the
easiest, as consisting in mere refraining from action, unless the passions that resist reason have
somehow to be checked at times. Again, it is likewise the most necessary duty, because without it
the social life could in no way exist. For with the man who confers no benefit upon me, who makes
no interchange even of the common duties with me, I can still live at peace, provided he injure me
in no way. In fact, from the vast majority of men we desire nothing more than that. Benefits are
generally exchanged by the few. But with the man who injures me, I cannot by any means live
peaceably. For nature has implanted in each man so sensitive a love of self and one's own
possessions, that one cannot help repelling by every means the man who essays to injure them.

3. Moreover, this same duty is a bulwark not only to what a man has by nature itself, for instance,
life, body, members, chastity, freedom, but also to all that has been acquired through some
institution and convention of men. Hence by this precept it is forbidden to carry off, spoil, injure,
or withdraw from our use, in whole or in part, anything that by any legitimate title is ours.
Consequently the same duty is understood to interdict any crimes by which injury is inflicted upon
others, as bloodshed, wounding, beating, robbery. theft, fraud, violence, directly or indirectly,
mediately or immediately and the like.

4. It follows also that, if a man has been hurt by another, or a loss inflicted in any way that can be
properly laid to the other's charge, it must so far as possible be made good by him. For otherwise
it would be a vain injunction, not to injure, or not to inflict loss, if the man who has actually been
injured must swallow his loss, and his assailant can in security, and without refunding, enjoy the
profit of the wrong he has done. For human depravity will never refrain from mutual injuries, unless
there is the necessity of restitution. And it would be difficult for the man who has suffered loss to
make up his mind to live at peace with the other, so long as he did not obtain reparation from him.

5. Although, properly speaking, loss appears to concern an injury to things, the word is however
understood by us here in a broad sense, to include every injury, spoiling, diminishing, or taking
away, of that which is already ours; or intercepting of that which by a perfect right we ought to have,
whether this may have been given us by nature, or assigned us by act of man, or by a law; or, finally,
any omission or refusal on the part of another to perform anything which he was bound to do for us
in accordance with a perfect obligation. But if things due us under an imperfect obligation merely
are intercepted, it is not considered that a loss has been inflicted, which must be made good. For it
would be unseemly to consider it a loss not to have received, or to demand compensation for, such
things as I could not expect from another except as a voluntary gift, and things which I cannot

6. Under the term loss, moreover, comes not only a thing of ours, or owed to us, which is injured,
destroyed, or intercepted, but also the fruits which spring from it, whether they have been gathered
in already, or are still hoped for, provided the owner would have gathered them in. But we must
deduct the outlay necessary to the gathering in of the crops. Also the valuation of anticipated crops
is raised or lowered, according as they arc nearer Ac uncertain outcome, or further from it. Finally
also, whatever flows later from an injury, as by natural necessity, is regarded as an integral part of
the damage.

7. It is moreover possible for a man to inflict toss upon another not only immediately and of himself,
bat also through others- And a loss caused immediately by a man can be imputed to the other,
because, by doing something, or not doing something, he was bound to do, he has contributed to that
result. Sometimes, as between several who have concurred in the same act, one is regarded as the
principal cause, another as an accessory; sometimes all are on an even footing. With regard to these,
we must observe that they are bound to make good the loss only in case they were realty the cause
of the loss, and were a factor in the whole loss, or a part thereof. But when a man did not contribute
any real assistance to that act itself which occasioned the loss, and did not previously cause it to be
undertaken, and did not share in the profit, although at the time of the act he may involve himself
in some misdeed, still he will not be bound to make restitution for Ac loss. Examples are, those who
rejoice at others' misfortunes, those who afterward praise or excuse the damage, and those who
beforehand hope it may happen, and approve or applaud at the time.

8. When several concur in a single act from which damage results, the first responsibility will be his,
who by his authority, or in some other way involving constraint, urged others to act. The doer of the
deed, if it was not open to him to refuse his services, will be accounted a mere instrument. Whoever
without constraint has committed a crime will himself be responsible first of all, and then the others
who contributed to the crime; with this reservation, that if the first in order have already made
restitution, the rest are exempt (which is not the case with penalties). If several have committed a
crime by conspiracy, they are collectively responsible for the individuals, and individually for all
their companions, so that if all are arrested, each is bound to contribute his proper share to make
good the damage. Where only one is seized, and the rest escape, he will be bound to pay for them
all. But where some of those arrested are insolvent, the rich ones will be responsible for the whole
amount. If, however, several have concurred in a crime without a conspiracy, and it can be clearly
distinguished how much each has contributed to the damage, each will be bound to make good that
part alone which was due to himself. But if one has paid the whole amount, the rest are exempt from
restitution.

9. Not alone the man who has injured another with malice aforethought, is bound to make good the
damage, but also he who, without direct intention, has done so through neglect, or a fault which it
was easy to avoid. For it is not the smallest part of sociability, to act so circumspectly that our
intercourse does not become formidable or insufferable to others. And then, in consequence of a
particular obligation, one is often required to use extraordinary diligence. In fact even the slightest
fault can suffice to require restitution, provided the nature of the matter does not actually resent, as
it were, the most exact diligence; or if the blame does not belong rather to the man who suffers the
damage, than to him who causes it; or unless great excitement, or the circumstances of the case, do
not admit a studied circumspection; for example, if one, while brandishing his arms in the heat of
battle, should injure a man standing near him.

10. But whoever injures by mere chance, and without his own fault is not bound to make restitution.
For nothing having been committed which can be laid to the man's charge, there is no reason why
the unwilling agent should atone for an evil that was destined to happen, rather than the other, who
has suffered it.

11. Another precept in agreement with natural equity is that, if my man has caused damage to
another without my fault, I should make it good to the injured party, or surrender my man to him.
For a slave is of course naturally liable for reparation of damage he has caused. But since he has no
property of his own, from which reparation may be made, and his person belongs to the master, it
is surely right that the master should either mend the damage or surrender the slave. For otherwise
a slave would be given license to injure any persons at his pleasure, if damages could not be
recovered either from himself, who has nothing, not even himself, or from his master. For if, on
account of an injury, a master is ever so willing to punish the slave with blows or imprisonment, the
injured cannot possibly be satisfied thereby.

12. The same principle also seems to be right with regard to our animals, that when, even without
our fault, and being of themselves excited contrary to the nature of their kind, they have caused
damage to another man, the master should either make good the damage, or surrender the animal.
For if I had been injured by an animal living in its natural freedom, I could certainly repair my loss
in any way, seizing or killing the beast, -- a right which evidently could not have been taken away
by the fact of ownership on the part of another. And since the owner receives gain from the animal,
while I have suffered a loss from the same, and since repairing a loss finds far greater favor than
making gain, it is clear that I may rightly demand of the master of the animal, that he make good the
loss, or else, if the animal is not worth so much in his estimation, deliver it up to me.

13. So then, if a man has without malice aforethought caused damage to another, he is bound to
make a voluntary offer of restitution, and testify that he was far from any malice, that the injured
party may not hold him an enemy, and on his side plan acts of hostility. But one who has injured
another maliciously, is not only bound to make a free offer of restitution, but also to show his
repentance, and ask pardon. On the other side, the injured, once he has obtained restitution, is bound
to grant pardon to the penitent who begs for it, and to be reconciled to him. For he who is unwilling
to rest satisfied with restitution and repentance, but sets out to avenge himself anyhow with his own
hand, is only humoring the bitterness of his heart, and so for an empty reason breaking the peace
among men. For this reason even the natural law condemns vengeance, which has no other end than
to harm those who have injured us, and satisfy our feelings with their suffering. But it is proper that
men should be the more inclined to forgive mutual offenses, the more frequently they themselves
violate the laws of the supreme Deity, and hence have daily need of forgiveness themselves.


CHAPTER 7
On Recognition of the Natural Equality of Men


1. Man is an animal not only most devoted to self-preservation, but one in which has been implanted
a sensitive self-esteem. And if this be in any way slighted, he is in general no less perturbed, than
if an injury has been inflicted upon his person or property. Even the word man is thought to contain
a certain dignity, so that the last and most effective argument in repelling the insolent contempt of
others is this: "I am certainly not a dog, but a man as well as you." Inasmuch then as human nature
is the same for all alike, and no one is perfectly willing or able to be associated with another, who
does not esteem him as at least equally a man and a sharer in the common nature; therefore, among
the mutual duties the second place is given to this: that each esteem and treat the other as naturally
his equal, that is, as a man just as much as himself.

2. But this equality of men consists not only in the fact that adult men are about equal in strength,
in so far as the weaker can inflict death upon the stronger by ambush, or with the help of dexterity,
or an effective weapon; but also in this, that, although one has been fitted out by nature with various
gifts of mind and body beyond the other, he must none the less practice the precepts of natural law
toward other men, and himself expects the same treatment from others; and in the fact that no more
freedom is given the man to injure others on that account. So, conversely too, niggardliness of nature
or straitened circumstances do not of themselves condemn a man to a lot inferior to that of others
as regards the enjoyment of the common right. But what one can demand or expect from another,
that others too must demand of him, other things being equal. And it is eminently proper that one
should himself practice the law which he has set up for others. For the obligation to cultivate the
social life with others binds all men equally, and one is no more permitted than another to violate
the natural laws in their dealings with each other. And yet popular arguments are not lacking to
illustrate that equality; for example, that we all descend from the same stock, and are born, fed, and
die in the same manner; and that God has given no man assurance of a stable and unshaken fortune.
So also the injunctions of the Christian religion do not commend nobility, power, or wealth, as a
means of gaining the favor of God, but sincere piety, which can be found in the humble, just as well
as in the great.

3. Moreover, it follows from this equality that he who wishes to use the services of others for his
own advantage, is bound in turn to spend himself, that their wants may be satisfied. For the man who
demands that others serve him, but on the other hand desires to be always immune himself, is
certainly considering others not equal to himself. Hence, as those who readily allow the same
permission to all as to themselves, are the best adapted to society, so those are plainly unsociable
who, thinking themselves superior to others, wish to have all things permitted to themselves alone,
and arrogate honor to themselves above the rest, and the lion's share of the things common to all,
to which they have no better right than the others. Accordingly this too is one of the common duties
of the natural law: that no one, who has not acquired a peculiar right, arrogate more to himself than
the rest have, but permit others to enjoy the same right as himself.

4. The same equality shows how a man should conduct himself, when he must assign their various
rights to others, viz., that he must treat them as equals, and not indulge the one as against the other,
except on the merits of the case. For if this is not done, the man not favored is affronted as well as
injured, and the esteem Nature gave him is taken away. It follows then that a common thing must
be duly divided in equal portions among equals. When it does not admit of division, those who have
an equal right ought to use it *in common, and this as much as each shall please, if the amount
permits. But if this is impracticable, they should then use the thing after a manner prescribed, and
in proportion to the number of the users. For no other method of respecting equality can be devised.
But if the thing can neither be divided nor held in common, let the enjoyment of it be alternate; or
if this also fails, or no equivalent can be furnished the rest, the thing must be awarded to one by lot.
For in cases of this kind no better remedy than the lot can be found, since this takes away the sense
of a slight, and if it fails to favor a man, it does not detract from his esteem.

5. Men sin against this duty by arrogance, thanks to which a man, for no reason, or an insufficient
one, prefers himself to others, and despises them, as though they were not his equals. I say "for no
reason"; for when a man has duly acquired a right, which gives him preference over others, he is
justified in exercising and maintaining it, short of vain conceit, however, or contempt for others. So,
conversely, anyone does well in yielding to another the precedence and honor which is his due. For
the rest, true generosity always has as its companion a certain humility, which consists in reflecting
upon the weakness of our nature, and the errors we may have formerly committed, or may hereafter
commit, -- errors not less than those which others may commit. The result of this humility is that we
do not prefer ourselves to anyone, reflecting that the rest can use their free will quite as well as
ourselves, as the same power is theirs. And its legitimate use is the one thing which a man can count
as his own, and by which he is enabled to esteem or despise himself. But to be puffed up for no
reason, is a fault truly ridiculous; because it is foolish in itself to think much of one's self for
nothing; and also because one is judging all others fools, as if they would esteem you without
reason.

6. A greater sin still is committed, if one show contempt for others by outward signs, acts, words,
countenance, a laugh, or any kind of slur. And this sin is to be rated the worse, in proportion as it
excites men the more fiercely to anger and lust for revenge. So much so, that many are found who
prefer to expose their lives to immediate danger, -- much more to break the peace with others, -- than
to let an insult go unavenged. For this damages reputation and esteem, upon whose maintenance and
strength depends all their inward pleasure.


CHAPTER 8
On the Common Duties of Humanity


1. Among the duties of men in general to others in general, and those which are to be practiced for
the sake of the common sociability, the third place is taken by this: that every man promote the
advantage of another, so far as he conveniently can. For since Nature has established a kind of
kinship among men, it would not be enough to have refrained from injuring or despising others; but
we must also bestow such attentions upon others, -- or mutually exchange them, -- that thus mutual
benevolence may be fostered among men. Now we benefit others either definitely or indefinitely,
and that with a loss, or else without loss, to ourselves.

2. A man tends to promote the advantage of others indefinitely, if he thoroughly cultivates his own
soul and body, so that useful actions may emanate from him to others; or if by ingenuity he finds
the means of making human life better equipped. Hence it is against this duty that they are to be
thought sinners, who learn no honorable art, pass their life in silence, and have a soul "only as so
much salt, to keep the body from decay," -- "mere numbers," and " born to consume the fruits of
earth." Also those who, content with the riches left by their ancestors, think they may with impunity
offer sacrifice to indolence, since the industry of others has already gained for them means to live
upon; "Or brooded selfishly o'er hoards of gold, Nor spared a portion for their kindred." So also
those who, like swine, cheer no one except by their death; and other such cumberers of the ground.

3. But to those who endeavor to be benefactors of the human race, the rest owe this in return, that
they be not envious, throw no obstacle in the way of their noble efforts. Also that, if there be no
other way of compensating them, they at least promote their fame and memory, this being the chief
reward of labors.

4. But especially is it regarded as contemptible malignity and inhumanity, not to bestow willingly
upon others those blessings which can be accorded without loss, trouble, or labor to ourselves. These
are usually called mere favors, that is, benefitting the recipient, and not burdening the giver.
Examples are: not to exclude from running water, to allow taking fire from our fire, to give honest
advice to one in doubt, to point out the way kindly to him who has lost it. So if a man does not wish
to possess a thing any longer, on account of an embarrassment of riches, or because maintenance
is a burden to him, why should he not prefer to leave the thing intact, so that he can give the use of
it to others, public enemies excepted, rather than spoil it. Thus it is not right to waste food, after we
have sated ourselves, nor to stop up a spring, or hide it, after we have had enough to drink; nor to
destroy aids to navigation or road-marks after we have used them. Here belong moderate alms
bestowed by the rich upon the needy; also that kindness which is shown for good reason to travelers,
especially when some misfortune has overtaken them; and other things of the sort.

5. A higher form of humanity is bestowing freely upon another, and out of rare benevolence,
something costing money or painful effort, designed to meet his needs, or win for him some signal
advantage. These are called benefits par excellence, and they offer the best opportunity to gain
praise, if only nobility of spirit and prudence duly control them. The dispensing of these and their
proper limits are governed generally by the situation of the giver and that of the recipient. And here
we must take special care that our generosity do not injure both those to whom we think we are
doing a kind turn, and the others too; also that the generosity be not greater than our means; and
again that we give to each in proportion to his worth, and above all to those who have deserved well;
also in proportion to their need of our help, and with regard also to the different degrees of closeness
in the relations of men. We must also consider what each needs most, and what he can accomplish
or not, with or without us. The manner of giving too adds much to the acceptability of favors, if we
give with cheerful face, readily, and with assurance of our good-will.

6. In return there must be gratitude in the mind of the recipient. Thus he shows that the gift was
acceptable to him, and for that reason he favors the giver, and seeks an occasion to make an equal
or larger return, in so far as be can. For it is not necessary to return precisely the amount of the gift;
but often zeal and endeavor satisfy the obligation. However there must be no reasonable exception
which we can take, as against the man who claims to have done us a favor. For example, I owe
nothing to the man who has pulled me out of the water, if he first threw me in.

7. But the better suited favors are to attach the affections of men to the giver, the more earnestly
must the recipient devote himself to showing his gratitude. At least we must not allow a man who,
trusting us, has forestalled us in a kind deed, to be on that account in a worse situation. Nor should
we receive a favor, except with the purpose of preventing the giver from repenting of his gift with
good reason. For, if for a certain reason we are particularly unwilling to be under obligations to a
man, it will be permissible to decline the favor tactfully. And certainly if there were no necessity of
showing gratitude, it would be unreasonable for a man to throw away his property recklessly, and
hasten to confer a favor which he foresees will be lost. In this way all beneficence and confidence
between men would be destroyed, and likewise all benevolence; and there would be no gratuitous
assistance, nor any first step in winning men.

8. Again, although there is in itself no injury in ingratitude, still it is considered more shameful,
odious, and detestable, to be called ungrateful than unjust. For it is thought the mark of a very low
and degenerate mind, to show one's self unworthy of the favorable judgment which the other has
passed upon one's character, and to be incapable of rousing one's self to feelings of humanity in
return for kindnesses which charm even the brutes. But in a civil court no action is usually granted
for simple ingratitude, or if a man forgets a mere favor, and when opportunity is given, still neglects
to requite it. For if an action be allowed, as for a certain sum of money, the best part of the favor
perishes, as it will now begin to be a loan. And whereas it is now a most honorable thing to be
grateful, it will cease to be so conspicuously honorable, if it be necessary. Finally, all the courts in
the world would hardly suffice for this one law, on account of the difficulty of appraising the
circumstances which increase or diminish a favor. And the very reason why I gave the favor, i.e.,
why I did not stipulate that it should be repaid, was that the other man might have an opportunity
to show that he has been grateful, from the love of what is honorable, not from the fear of human
punishment or compulsion; and, on my part, that I may be understood to have bestowed it, not in
hope of gain, but in order to practice humanity, being unwilling to demand security for the return
of the gift. But he who not only does not repay a favor, but also actually requites his benefactor with
evil, deserves all the more severe penalty for so doing, in proportion as he shows a more infamous
malignity within.


CHAPTER 9
On the Duties of Contracting Parties in General


1. From the absolute duties we pass to the conditional, by way of agreements as a transition; since
all the duties not already enumerated seem to presuppose an express or tacit agreement. We have
then to treat here of the nature of agreements, and what is to be observed by those who enter into
them.

2. Now it is sufficiently clear that it was necessary for men to enter into agreements. For, although
the duties of humanity are widely diffused throughout human life, it is still impossible to deduce
from that one source all that men were entitled to receive to advantage from one another. For not all
have such natural goodness, that they are willing, out of mere humanity, to do all the things by
means of which they may benefit others, without an assured hope of receiving the like in return.
Often, too, favors which can come to us from others, are of a sort to make us unable to demand
without a blush that they be done for us for nothing. And frequently it is unbecoming to our station
or person to owe such a favor to another. And in fact, as the other is unable to give much, so we are
often unwilling to accept, unless he receives an equivalent from us. Finally, not uncommonly others
are in the dark as to how they may serve our interests. Therefore, in order that the mutual duties of
men (the fruit, that is, of sociability) may be discharged more frequently and according to certain
rules, it was necessary for men to agree among themselves, as to the mutual performance of all that
they could not certainly promise themselves from others, on the basis of the law of humanity alone.
And indeed it was necessary to determine in advance, what one was bound to perform for another,
and what the latter should in turn expect and exact as his right from the former. And this is done by
promises and agreements.

3. In regard to these, the general duty which we owe under natural law is, that a man keep his
plighted word, that is, fulfill his promises and agreements. For, but for this, we should lose the
greatest part of the advantage which is apt to arise for the race from the interchange of services and
property. And were there not the necessity of keeping promises, one could not build one's
calculations firmly upon the support of others. And also from a breach of faith there are apt to arise
entirely just causes for quarrels and war. For when I have performed something in accordance with
an agreement, if the other defaults his promise, I have lost my property, or my services, for nothing.
But if, on the other hand, I have not yet performed anything, it is still an annoyance to have my
calculations and plans disturbed, since I could have made other provision for my affairs, if he had
not presented himself. And it is a shame to be mocked because I believed the other a prudent and
honest man.

4. We must observe also, that what we owe under the mere duty of humanity differs from what is
owed by virtue of a compact or perfect promise especially in this respect, viz., that things of the
former class are properly asked, and honorably performed; but when the other has failed of his own
motion to perform, I can complain merely of his inhumanity, barbarity, or harshness; but I cannot
compel him to perform, by my own force or that of my superior. This is my privilege, however,
when he does not of himself perform what is due in accordance with a perfect promise or a compact.
Hence we are said in the former case to have an imperfect right, in the latter, a perfect right, as also
to be obligated imperfectly in the one case, and perfectly in the other.

5. We give our word either by a solitary, or one-sided, act, or by a reciprocal, or two-sided, act. For
sometimes one man merely binds himself to some performance, sometimes two or more bind
themselves mutually to some performance. The former act is called a gratuitous promise, the latter
a compact.

6. Promises can be divided into the imperfect and the perfect. We have the former when we who
promise are indeed willing to be bound, in such a way, however, that we do not give the other the
right to exact, or are unwilling to be compelled by force to fulfill our promise. For example, if I thus
frame my promise: "I have determined in all seriousness to perform this or that for you; and I ask
you to believe me." For thus I seem obligated rather under the law of veracity, than that of justice;
and I prefer to be thought impelled to discharge the duty by my own constancy and solidity of
character, rather than in view of another's right. Here belong the promises of men of power or
influence, when in seriousness, and not in compliment they pledge to a man their recommendation,
intercession, advancement, or support. They do not, however, desire by any means that these things
be exacted of them as by some right, but wish to have them set down wholly to their humanity and
their veracity, so that gratitude for performing their duty may be the greater, the further it was
removed from compulsion.

7. A perfect promise, on the other hand, is when I am not only willing to be bound in any case, but
also confer upon the other at the same time a right, so that he can demand of me in full, as owed to
him, the thing I promised.

8. Moreover, that promises and compacts may bind us to give or do something not formerly required
of us, or to omit what we previously had a right to do, our voluntary consent is most essential. For,
since the fulfillment of any promise and agreement is associated with some burden, there is no better
reason to prevent our justly complaining about it, than the fact that we voluntarily consented to what
it was evidently in our own power to avoid.

9. Consent is, to be sure, regularly and usually expressed by signs, for example, words, letters, and
nods; but it sometimes happens that without these signs, from the very nature of the business and
other circumstances, consent is clearly inferred. Thus at times silence, considered together with
certain circumstances, is effective, instead of a sign of consent. Hence there are also tacit
agreements, namely when our consent is expressed not by such signs as are regularly accepted in
men's intercourse; but when it is clearly inferred from the nature of the business and other
circumstances. So too, a principal agreement has often attached to it a tacit agreement, which flows
from the very nature of the business. And so also it is very common in compacts for certain tacit
exceptions and necessary conditions to be understood.

10. But to be able to give clear consent, the use of reason is required to this extent, that one
understand the business in hand, whether it is proper for one, and can be performed by one; and then,
when this has been weighed, that one be able to indicate his consent by sufficient signs. Hence it
follows that the promises and agreements of infants, as also of idiots and the insane except where
their madness is marked off by lucid intervals), are null. And this must also be declared of the
promises of the intoxicated, if intoxication has already gone so far that reason is plainly
overpowered and stupefied. For it cannot be called a true and deliberate consent, if a man incline
ever so much to an act by a momentary and unconsidered impulse, or give signs under other
circumstances indicative of consent, at a time when the mind has been, as it were, displaced by some
drug. Moreover it would be shameless to exact the fulfillment of such a promise, especially if
involving a great burden. Again, if a man lay in wait for such intoxication, and observing the other's
complaisance, cunningly extracted a promise, he will not be immune even from the charge of
trickery and fraud. But whoever, after shaking off his intoxication, has confirmed his acts during that
state, will certainly be obligated, not on the score of what he did when drunk, but of what he did
when sober.

11. As for children, how long weakness of reason, hindering them from contracting an obligation,
lasts in their case, cannot, in general, be very accurately defined, since in some judgment matures
more quickly, in others more slowly. But that must be judged by the daily actions of each child. And
yet in most states civil laws have established here a certain limit of time. So also in some places it
is a salutary custom, that in contracting obligations infants must employ the authorization of more
prudent persons, until the rash impulsiveness of youth is thought to have cooled off. For that age,
even when it understands the business in hand, is generally carried away by a strong and
short-sighted impulse, and is easy in making promises, hopeful, seeking a reputation for liberality,
prone to interested friendships, and unacquainted with distrust. Hence he is scarcely to be acquitted
of trickery, who takes advantage of that easy-going age, and wishes to enrich himself by the losses
of others, which they, on account of feeble judgment, know not how to foresee or to estimate.

12. Consent is further hindered by an error. With regard to this, these rules must be observed: (1)
When in a promise I have supposed anything as a condition, without reference to which I should not
have promised, naturally the promise will have no force. For the promisor agreed not absolutely, but
on a condition; and this not being realized, the promise too is null. (2) If I was led to agree or
contract in consequence of an error, and I shall discover it while the matter is still intact and nothing
has as yet been performed, it will certainly be equitable to allow me the opportunity to repent;
especially if, in entering the agreement, I have openly declared the reason impelling me thereto, and
if the other suffers no loss from my change of mind, or I am ready to make it good. But when the
matter is no longer untouched, and the error becomes known only after the agreement has been
fulfilled in whole or in part, the man who was mistaken cannot withdraw from his agreement, except
in so far as the other is willing out of humanity to indulge him. (3) When an error has arisen in
regard to the very thing which was the object of the agreement, the latter is vitiated, not so much on
account of the error, as because the terms of the agreement were not satisfied. For in agreements the
object in regard to which they agree, and its qualities, ought to be known, without which knowledge
clear consent is unintelligible. Hence, on the discovery of a defect, the man who would have been
injured can either withdraw from the contract, or compel the other to make good the defect, or even
to pay the difference, when trickery or a fault on his part was involved.

13. But if a man was induced by the other's trickery and malicious fraud to promise or contract, we
must hold these principles: (1) If a third person has employed guile, without collusion of the
contracting party, the matter will stand; but from him who employed guile we shall be able to
demand what we should have gained, if we had not been deceived. (2) If a man by guile has given
me occasion to promise him something, or make some agreement with him I am not bound to him
at all in consequence of that act (3) If a man shall enter into an agreement voluntarily and with
evident intention, but still guile shall appear in the affair itself, for instance, in regard to the object,
or its qualities and value, the agreement will be defective, so much so, that it is within the discretion
of the deceived party to dissolve it entirely, or to demand compensation for the damage. (4) Matters
not essential to the affair, and not expressly mentioned, do not vitiate an agreement otherwise made
in due form, even though one of the parties may have made a tacit assumption while contracting, or
his belief may have been cunningly confirmed, until the contract should be concluded.

14. Fear, as involved in promises and agreements, is understood in two senses: either as a plausible
suspicion, that we may be deceived by the other, either because such a defect is inherent in his mind,
or else because he has shown quite clearly his malicious intention ; or, in the second place, as great
terror, arising from the threat of serious harm, if we are unwilling to promise, or to enter the
agreement. With regard to the former kind of fear we must understand: (1) That whoever trusts the
promises and agreements of a man whose honor is in general worthless, acts imprudently to be sure;
but that an agreement is not made void by that sole cause. (2) When the agreement has been once
entered into, and no new indications come to light of a deception aimed at us, it will not be open to
us to withdraw from the agreement, on the pretext of defects which were recognized before it was
made. For a reason which did not prevent a man from contracting, ought not to prevent him from
fulfilling his contract. (3) When after the agreement has been entered very evident indications come
to light, that the other man plans to cheat me, after I have first done my part, then I cannot be
compelled to do so, until security has been given me against that deception.

15. With regard to the other species of fear, these rules are to be observed: (1) Contracts entered into
on account of fear inspired by a third party are valid. For in this certainly no defect is involved, to
prevent the other man from getting his rights under the contract as against me, and he certainly
deserves compensation for having removed the fear inspired by the third party. (2) Contracts entered
into from fear of, or respect for, legitimate authority, or through deference to those to whom we are
under great obligations, are valid. (3) Contracts into which a man is unjustly forced by the very
person to whom he gives the promise, or with whom he contracts, are invalid. For the injury which
he inflicts upon me by inspiring an unjust fear, renders him incapable of claiming his rights against
me under the agreement. And since one is otherwise bound to make good a loss occasioned by
himself, therefore, if what should have been at once restored, is not paid, then the obligation is
annulled by the counter-claim.

16. Furthermore, consent should be mutual, not only in contracts, but also in promises, so that both
promisor, and promisee, must consent. For when the consent of the latter is lacking, or when he has
refused to accept the offered promise, the thing promised remains in the hands of the promisor. For
he who offers something of his own to another, neither wishes to obtrude it upon him against his
will, nor to consider it ownerless. Hence, if the other does not accept it, the right of the promisor
over the thing offered is undiminished. But if there was a previous request, it will be held to
continue, unless expressly recalled; and in that case acceptance is understood to have taken place
in advance, provided the offer corresponds to the request. For if there is a discrepancy here, an
express acceptance is required, since often my interests are not served, unless I receive the amount
for which I asked.

17. As for the subject-matter of promises and agreements, it is required that what we promise or
agree to, be not beyond our powers, and that we be not forbidden by some law to perform it. For
otherwise we are making either a foolish or a criminal promise. It follows then that no one can bind
himself to what is for him impossible. If, however, a thing considered possible at the time of entering
the agreement, has later by some chance become impossible, for no fault of the contractor, if nothing
has yet been done, the contract will be void. If anything has been already done by the other, it must
be restored, or an equivalent repaid. If even this is impossible, the greatest pains must be taken, that
the other suffer no loss. For in contracts we have regard primarily to that upon which there was
express agreement. When we cannot obtain this, it suffices if an equivalent is furnished. At least we
must by all means take care that we experience no loss. But a man who, by guile or serious fault, has
diminished his own powers of performance, is not only bound to make the utmost efforts, but can
be punished into the bargain, to make good, as it were, any deficiency.

18. It is clear also that we cannot be bound to perform anything unlawful. For no one can effectively
put himself under an obligation beyond his own power. But he who by a law forbids an action, of
course takes away the power of undertaking it, and of accepting an obligation to perform it. For it
would be a contradiction, to be bound absolutely under an obligation confirmed by the laws to do
something forbidden by the same laws. Hence he who promises unlawful acts is guilty; twice guilty
he who performs such promises. From which we further conclude that promises which will be
injurious to him for whom they are made, ought not to be kept; since it is forbidden by the natural
law to cause harm to another, even if he foolishly desires it. If then an agreement concerning a
shameful thing has been entered into, neither party will be bound to perform it. In fact, even when
the shameful deed has been committed by one of them, the other will not be bound to pay the wages
agreed upon. But whatever has already been given with such a motive, cannot be recovered, unless
trickery or extraordinary damage may be involved.

19. Finally, it is also clear that promises or agreements affecting things belonging to others are void,
in so far as these are subject not to our direction and will, but to those of another. But if I promise
to exert myself to have the other perform something (presupposing that I cannot command him by
authority), then, by every means morally possible (i.e., in so far as the other can ask it of me
honorably, and regard for the civil life permits), I am bound to use my efforts to persuade him to do
his part. Moreover, as regards things or actions of mine, to which another has by this time acquired
a right, I cannot make a valid promise to a third person, except with a view to the possibility that the
other's right may expire. For one who by previous promises or agreements has already transferred
his right to another, certainly has no longer any right left, such as he can confer upon a third person.
And it would be no trouble to void all promises and agreements, if it were permitted to enter upon
another, which made contrary dispositions and could not be fulfilled at the same time with the
previous agreement. Upon this Tests the old saying, "First in time, first in right."

20. With regard to promises it is further to be particularly observed, that they are usually made either
simply and absolutely, or under a condition, that is, the validity of the promise is attached to some
occurrence depending upon chance or the will of man. Now conditions arc either possible or
impossible. The former are subdivided into the casual or fortuitous, the existence or non-existence
of which is not in our power; discretionary or arbitrary, the existence or non-existence of which is
in the power of him to whom the promise is given; and mixed, the fulfillment of which depends
partly upon the will of him to whom the promise is given, and partly upon chance. The impossible
conditions are such either physically or morally, that is, some things cannot in the nature of things
be done, and some ought not to be, as contrary to laws and morality. And impossible conditions, if
we follow the natural and simple interpretation, negative the language of a promise. And yet, legally
speaking, it is possible, in case they have been added in some serious affair, to regard them as
non-existent, that men may not be mocked by agreements which can have no outcome.

21. Finally, we promise and contract, not only of ourselves, but also through the intervention of
other men, whom we have ourselves appointed as go-betweens and interpreters of our will. And
when they in good faith have done what was contained in our instructions, we are under a valid
obligation to such persons as have dealt with them as our representatives.

22. Such are the absolute duties of man, as also those which serve as a transition to the other kind.
The rest presuppose either some human institution, based upon a universal convention, and
introduced among men, or else some particular form of government. Of such institutions we observe
in particular three: language, ownership and value, and human government. We must next explain
each of these, together with the resulting duties.


CHAPTER 10
On the Duty of the Users of Language


1. There is no one who does not know how useful and entirely necessary an instrument of human
society language is. For many have inferred from that faculty alone that man was destined by Nature
to lead a social life. Hence, as regards its legitimate and profitable use for human society, natural
law prescribes to men this duty, that no one deceive another by language, or by other signs designed
to express the thoughts of the mind.

2. But, the more thoroughly to understand the nature of language, we must know that there is a
twofold obligation as regards language expressed viva voce or in writing. One is that by which users
of the same language are bound to apply a certain word to a certain thing, according to the usage of
the particular tongue. For neither sounds nor certain shapes of letters naturally mark a certain thing,
for otherwise all tongues or kinds of writing ought to be identical. Hence, that the use of language
be not in vain, if each were to call a thing by any name he pleased, there must be among the users
of the same language a tacit convention, to designate a certain thing by a certain word and no other.
For unless there has been agreement upon a uniform application of words, it is impossible to gather
from another's speech the thoughts of his mind. Therefore by virtue of that compact every man is
bound in common speech to employ words according as the established usage of that language
prescribes. Hence it follows also that, although thoughts may possibly be out of harmony with
speech, in human life each is thought to have meant just what his words indicate, even though the
inward purpose of the mind may be at variance with them. For as to that, nothing can be known
except by signs, and thus all use of language would be rendered of no effect, if in the common life
the inward thought, which each can feign according to his own caprice, could nullify the meaning
of the signs.

3. The other obligation which has to do with language consists in this, that a man ought so to reveal
his thoughts to another by language, that they may be clearly known to him. For, since man has the
power not only to speak, but also to be silent, and is not bound to disclose what he has in mind
openly to all and sundry, therefore there must exist a particular obligation, to impose upon one the
necessity both of speaking, and of so speaking that another can understand our thoughts. And that
obligation arises either from a particular agreement, or from a common precept of the natural law,
or from the nature of the business in hand, in the transaction of which speech is employed. For often
there is an express agreement with a man, that he disclose to me his mind concerning some matter
of business, for example, if I engage a man to teach me some subject. Often too some precept of the
natural law bids me share my knowledge with another, that so I may help him, or avert some harm
for him, or avoid furnishing cause or occasion for his suffering harm. Finally, sometimes the affair
in hand, begun with another, cannot be completed, unless I disclose my judgment in the matter, as
is the case in making contracts.

4. But as it does not always happen that under some one of these beads I am required to make known
my mind to another, it is evident that I am bound to indicate to him in speech only such matters as
he has a right, either perfect or imperfect, to learn from me; and hence also that, no matter how
insistent the questions are, I can rightly conceal things which the other has no right to know from
me, and which I am bound by no obligation to reveal.

5. In fact since language was invented not only for others, but also for our own sake, for that reason,
where some advantage of mine is involved, and no other man's right is injured, I may so shape my
speech as to express something different from what is in my mind.

6. Finally, as those to whom we speak are often so situated that, if they should learn the fact in plain
and open language, it would be to their own injury, and we should be unable to accomplish the good
end which we have in view, it will therefore be permissible in these cases to use fictitious and
figurative language, not directly conveying our meaning and intention to the hearers. For he who
desires to benefit a man, and ought to do so, is certainly not bound to do it in a way which would
defeat his own end.

7. From these principles we learn what constitutes the truth, devotion to which so highly commends
good men; namely, that words should aptly reproduce our thoughts to another, who has the right to
know them, and which we are under an obligation, perfect or imperfect, to disclose. And all this to
the intent that by knowledge of our mind he may gain some advantage which is due him, or may not
suffer an undeserved loss, if incorrectly informed. From this it is incidentally evident, that it is not
always a lie even when purposely we do not say what exactly squares either with the fact, or with
our thoughts; and thus that logical truth, which consists in the conformity of words to things, does
not altogether coincide with moral truth.

8. It is a lie, however, when speech deliberately expresses an opinion different from our real mind,
in spite of the fact that the person addressed had a right to know it, and that an obligation rested
upon us to let him at least know our opinion.

9. From what has been said it is then established that the stigma of a lie is not incurred by those who
employ fictions and fables for the better information of children or the childlike, since they lack
capacity for the naked truth. The same is true of others who make use of fiction for a good end
which they could not attain by plain language; for example, if they must protect an innocent man,
appease the angry, comfort the sorrowing, encourage the timid, persuade the squeamish to take
medicines, break down someone's obstinacy, defeat another's evil intention; or in case secrets of
state and plans which ought to be kept from the knowledge of others, must be veiled by fictitious
reports, and the ill-timed curiosity of others disposed of; or if by tales, in lieu of a stratagem, we
baffle an enemy whom we might have injured openly.

10. On the other hand, if a man was indeed bound dearly to indicate his mind to another, he does not
escape blame, if he tells merely a part of the truth, or deceives another by ambiguous language, or
retains a tacit mental reservation, out of keeping with general practice.


CHAPTER 11
On the Duty of Those Who Take Oaths


1. By an oath it is held that a striking confirmation is added to our speech, and all the acts in which
speech has a part. For it is a religious affirmation, in which we renounce our claim upon the Divine
mercy, or call down the Divine punishment upon ourselves, if we do not tell the truth. And while
the omniscient and omnipotent witness, who is at the same time the avenger, is being invoked, the
presumption of truth is created by the fact that hardly anyone is thought so impious that he will dare
thus insolently to call down upon himself the dire wrath of the Deity. Hence it is understood to be
the duty of oath-takers to approach the oath with reverence, and then religiously to observe their
oath.

2. Moreover the end and use of an oath consists chiefly in this, that men may be bound all the more
firmly to declare the truth, or to keep promise or contract, by fear of the omniscient and omnipotent
Deity, whose vengeance, if they knowingly deceive, they call down upon themselves by the oath,
whereas the fear of men seemed ineffectual. For they hoped to be able to despise or elude men's
power, or escape their knowledge.

3. But because, aside from God, there is nothing omniscient or omnipotent, it is absurd to take an
oath by something which is not believed to be divine, with the idea that that thing is being invoked
as witness and punisher of perjury. And yet it is common in oaths to name a certain thing and swear
by it, with the understanding that, in case of perjury, God may wreak His vengeance on that
particular thing, as very dear to the deponent, and highly esteemed by him.

4. In oaths the formula, in which God is described, while invoked as witness and avenger, must be
adapted to that belief or religion which the taker of the oath cherishes in regard to God. For it is vain
to require of a man an oath by a god whom he does not believe in, and so does not fear. But no one
thinks he is swearing by God, if under another formula or under another name than that contained
in the teachings of his own religion, -- the true religion in the opinion of the deponent. Hence also
he who swears by false gods, whom he however holds to be true, is certainly bound, and in case he
deceives, really commits perjury. For under some special concept he had before his eyes a general
notion of deity, and so, in knowingly forswearing himself, he has violated, so far as in him lay, the
reverence due the majesty of God.

5. To the binding force of an oath it is necessary that it be undertaken with a deliberate intention.
Hence one who has read an oath aloud, or dictated its formal wording in the first person to another,
is not bound at all by an oath. But one who gave the appearance of intending seriously to swear,
certainly will be bound, no matter what he had in mind while swearing. For otherwise the whole
practice of oaths, or rather every means of binding one's self by recourse to outward signs, would
be taken away from human life, if by mental reservation one could prevent a formal act from having
the effect which it was designed to produce.

6. Oaths do not in themselves produce a new and particular obligation, but are added as a sort of
accessory bond to an obligation in itself valid. For always in swearing we suppose something, failing
to perform which, we call down upon us the Divine punishment. And this would be foolish, if it
were not unlawful to fail to perform the thing in question, in other words, if we were not already
bound. Hence it follows that formal arts, to which attaches a defect nullifying the obligation, do not
become obligatory by the addition of an oath. In the same way a previous valid agreement is not
destroyed by a subsequent oath, nor is a right which another had thereby acquired now taken away
from him. Therefore it is vain to swear that one will not pay one's debt to another. And an oath is
not binding when it is established that the swearer supposed some fact which in reality was not such,
and would not have sworn, if he had not so believed; especially if he was led into error by a trick
on the part of him to whom he swore. Also the man who by an unjust fear makes me take an oath
acquires in consequence of that oath no right legally to demand anything of me. Of no effect also
is an oath concerning the performance of an unlawful act; or even that which concerns the omission
of some good deed enjoined by laws divine or human. Finally, an oath does not change the nature
and substance of a promise or contract to which it is added. Hence it is in vain that one swears to
impossible things. And a conditional promise is not changed into an absolute or simple one by an
oath. And acceptance is required just as truly in the case of a promise under oath.

7. Moreover, by reason of the added appeal to God, whom none may deceive by cunning nor mock
with impunity, oaths have this effect, that not only is a severer penalty thought to await him who has
proved false to a sworn than an unsworn promise; but also that trickery and equivocation must be
excluded from dealings to which oaths are added.

8. Not always, however, are oaths to be interpreted in a broad sense, but also sometimes strictly, if
indeed the subject-matter seems to require it; for example, if the oath took the direction of hatred
toward another, and was added to threats, rather than to a promise. In fact even an oath does not
exclude tacit conditions and limitations, which properly flow from the very nature of the thing; for
example, if under oath I have given a man the privilege of asking anything that he pleases, in case
he asks unjust or absurd things, I shall not be bound at all. For whoever at another's request makes
an indefinite promise, not yet knowing what he is going to ask, presupposes that the other will ask
things honorable, morally possible, and not absurd or dangerous for himself or others.

9. We must also note that in oaths the sense of the whole text prevails as avowedly understood by
the man who tenders the oath, that is, the man to whom we swear. For it is in his interest especially,
not that of the swearer, that an oath is given. Hence it is his privilege also to frame the words of the
oath, and with all possible clearness. And he must show how he understands them, while the swearer
should declare that he clearly understands the meaning; and he must clearly pronounce the words,
so that he can in no way equivocate or evade.

10. The division of oaths is conveniently based upon the use to which they are put in the common
life. For some are added to promises and contracts, that they may be observed the more
scrupulously. And some are employed to confirm a man's assertion concerning a fart that is not dear,
and where the truth cannot be discovered more conveniently by other means. Such an oath is
demanded of witnesses, that is, persons thought to have knowledge of another's deed. Sometimes
also those who are at odds settle their suit by taking an oath, as proposed by the judge or the other
party.


CHAPTER 12
On Duty as regards the Acquisition of Ownership


1. Such is the constitution of the human body, that it needs for its nourishment things which it takes
from without, as also for its protection against whatever tends to destroy its structure, and that this
life can be made more comfortable and easy by a number of different things. Hence it is a safe
inference that it is with the entire consent of the great Ruler of the universe that man makes use of
other creatures for his own needs, and even destroys many of them. And this obtains not only as
regards vegetables, and things that are destroyed without sensation, but also concerning innocent
animals, which, in spite of the pain of their death, are killed and consumed by man for food without
sin.

2. But in the beginning all these things are understood to have been set out by God in the midst, as
it were, of awn. so that they belonged no more to one than to another; but so, however, that men
should make such arrangements in regard to them as the constitution of the human race, regard for
its peace and quiet, and the maintenance of good order seemed to demand. And thus, while the race
of mortals was limited to a few, it was decided that whatever a man had laid hold of, with the
intention of applying to his own needs, should be his. and ought not to be taken away from him by
another; but that the substances from which these things were derived, should remain in common,
not pertaining to any one in particular. But later, when men had multiplied, and cultivation had come
to be applied to the things from which food and clothing are produced for man, in order to avoid
quarrels, and to introduce good order, even the substances of things were also divided among men,
and to each his own portion was assigned. And this convention was added, that whatever in the first
division of things was left common, could thereafter become the property of the first claimant. So
then by the will of God, the consent of men in advance, and an agreement at least tacit, property in
things, or ownership, was introduced.

3. Ownership then is the right by which the substance, so to speak, of a thing belongs to ft man, so
that it does not belong as a whole in the same way to another. Hence it follows that we can dispose
as we please of things belonging properly to us, and can have acquired a special right from us by
agreement. Yet in states it usually happens that ownership is not always unrestricted in the case of
all men, but circumscribed with certain limits by civil authority, or by an arrangement or convention
which men have made with each other. When one thing, however, belongs to several in the same
way and without division, it is said to be common to those persons.

4. But as things have not come to be owned all together or at once, but successively, and as the need
of the human race seemed to require; so it was not necessary for every single thing to be
appropriated; but without detriment to the peace of the race some things could, and others should,
remain in the primeval common condition. For if things are useful indeed to men, but yet
inexhaustible, so that they can be free for all to use, and still the individual's use is not thereby more
niggardly, it would be superfluous and foolish to wish to divide them. Examples are the sun's heat
and light, air, running water, and the like. Here belongs also the vast ocean, lying between great
continents, so far as concerns those parts of it very distant from the coasts; since not only is it
entirely sufficient for the varied needs of all, but also its custody is morally impossible for any one
people. For when a thing is so constituted that others cannot by any means be excluded from its use,
to divide it, or make property of it, is superfluous, and also apt to furnish occasion for vain litigation.

5. The methods of acquiring ownership are either original or derivative. By the former a thing
becomes property in the beginning; by the latter an ownership already established passes from one
to another. Again the former are either absolutely such, -- and by these ownership of the substance
of a thing is acquired, -- or relatively, by which property already ours receives some accession.

6. After individual ownership of things had been adopted among men, it was agreed by them that
whatever had not come under the primitive division should fall to the occupant, that is, the first man
to seize the thing by physical means, with intent to keep it for himself. Hence to-day the only
original method of acquiring ownership of the substance of a thing is occupancy. By this means then
we acquire desert regions which no man ever claimed as his. These become the property of him who
first enters them with the intent to keep them for himself, bringing them under cultivation, and
establishing certain limits up to which he claims ownership. But when a numerous company jointly
occupies any tract of land, the common practice is to assign some part of it to the individual
members of the company, and to count the remainder as belonging to the whole company. By
occupancy also are acquired wild beasts, birds, fishes in the sea, rivers, or lakes; also whatever is
usually thrown up by the sea upon the shore; provided, however, the promiscuous capture of things
of this sort has not been interdicted by the civil authority, or assigned to some particular person. If
these are to become ours, we must seize them by physical means, and bring them into our power.
By occupancy also we acquire things, when the ownership to which they had previously been
subject has been clearly extinguished. For instance, things thrown away with the intent that they are
no longer to be ours, or things which we lose unwillingly in the first place, but later count as
abandoned. Here too belongs the treasure-trove, that is, money whose owner is unknown. This falls
to the finder, when it has not been ordained otherwise by the civil laws.

7. But very many things which are subject to ownership do not always remain in the same condition,
but enlarge their substance by various kinds of increase. Some others receive accession from
without; still others bring forth fruit; many have their value increased by the form which human
industry has added to them. All of which can be comprehended under the term accessions, and they
are divided into two classes. For some things are produced by their nature alone, without act of man;
some are procured by the act and industry of men, either wholly or in part. With regard to these there
is this rule, that if a man is the owner of a thing, to him also belong accessions and any profits; and
that he who has made a new product out of his own material, is the owner of that product.

8. Frequently, however, it has happened that other men, as the result of a contract, or other means,
have acquired a right to receive a certain benefit from a thing belonging to us, or to hinder us from
using a thing of ours without restriction. These rights are commonly called servitudes, and are
divided into personal servitudes, in which an advantage accrues directly to the person from the
property of another; and real servitudes, in which the advantage is derived from another's property
through the medium of our own. Among the former are numbered usufruct use, the right of dwelling,
the services of slaves. Again the real servitudes are divided into urban and rural. In the former class
are, for example, the servitude of a supporting wall or column, that of windows, those which prevent
the blocking of our light or view, that which requires one to receive the drippings of a roof, etc. To
the latter class belong, for instance, right of passing, that of driving, that of building a road or an
aqueduct, of drawing water, of driving cattle to water, of pasturage, etc. Nearly all of these have
been introduced as a result of proximity.

9. Among the derivative methods of acquisition there are some in which a thing passes to another
in accordance with the provision of a law, others in view of an act of the former owner. And the
result is either that a man's entire property is transferred, or a certain portion thereof.

10. An entire property passes by law to another through the death of the former owner in intestate
successions. For it would be repugnant to the general inclination of men, and not in the least
conducive to the peace of the human race, that property which a man had acquired with such labor
in his lifetime, should after the death of the owner be regarded as abandoned, and open to the
occupancy of anybody. Hence, under the guidance of reason, it has been accepted among all peoples,
that, if a man had himself made no disposition of his goods, these should devolve upon those whom,
in accordance with the common affection of men, he is thought to hold most dear. Such are regularly
those who descend from us, and then others connected with us by blood, each according to the
degree of propinquity. And though there are some men who, either on account of benefits received,
or out of peculiar affection, love certain strangers more than their own relatives, still the interests
of peace required men, neglecting the affection of a few, rather to follow the common inclination
of mortals, and to observe the simplest method of succession, and one exposed to no intricate
disputes. These would have cropped out, if benefactors and friends could compete with those who
rest their claim upon blood. And if the man had any wish to prefer benefactors or friends to kinsmen,
he should have made an express statement of the matter.

11. It follows then that a man's nearest heirs are his own children, whose maintenance and rearing
Nature has earnestly commended to parents; and every parent is supposed to have wished to provide
for them as amply as possible, and to leave to them by preference whatever remains to himself. And
by children we understand especially those born in lawful wedlock. For reason itself, and the
proprieties of the civil life, and the laws of the more civilized nations, favor such more than natural
children. But what has been said does not hold good, if a father has, for sufficient reasons, refused
to recognize a person as his son, or has disinherited him on account of shameful depravity. Under
children are further included those who belong to the remoter degrees. These the grandfather is
bound to support, their own parents being dead; and hence it is entirely just that grandchildren
should share the grandfather's estate, along with their uncles on both sides. Otherwise, in addition
to the misfortune of losing their father prematurely, they would be excluded from the grandfather's
estate. When there are no descendants, it is right that the property of deceased children devolve upon
their parents. Those who have no surviving children and parents, will be succeeded by their brothers.
When these too are lacking, the heirs will be determined by their degrees of consanguinity to the
deceased. In order, however, to avoid the suits which can very frequently arise in these cases, and
that the matter may be well adjusted to the interests of the state, we find that in most states the order
of succession has been precisely determined. And it is safest for citizens to follow this order, unless
important reasons force them to make a special disposition.

12. By act of the former owner an entire property passes after his death to another by virtue of a will.
For as a poor consolation for our mortality it has been established among most peoples that a man
can in his lifetime transfer his possessions in the event of death to him whom he loves most. But
whereas in the earliest times it appears to have been the practice, when death was imminent, to name
one's heirs openly, and to pass over the property actually into their hands, later, for weighty reasons,
many peoples preferred another form of will. This namely enabled a man, at any time he pleased,
either openly to indicate his last will, or silently to authenticate it in writing. And this he could
change at his discretion, while from it the heirs named viva voce or in writing derived no right until
the death of the testator. Such last wills deservedly enjoy high favor; yet they must be regulated as
the interests of relatives and the good of states requires. Hence the latter are accustomed to prescribe
by law how a man is to draw up his will. And whoever departs from such prescription, is unable to
complain that his will has been disregarded.

13. Among the living, things pass by act of the former owner either gratis, or by means of a contract.
Transfers of the former kind are called donations. Of contracts we must treat later.

14. Sometimes things are transferred even against the will of the former owner, and in states this is
especially by way of penalty, when men convicted of crimes have, now all their possessions, now
a certain part of them, taken away, and applied to the state or else to the injured party. So too in war,
things are taken away from unwilling owners by an enemy in superior force, and acquired by him
who seizes them. But the former owner does not lose his right to recover them by similar violence,
until by a subsequent treaty of peace he has renounced all claim to them.

15. Finally, there is a particular kind of acquisition called usucapio, or prescription, by which a man
who in good faith and by fair title has gained possession of a thing, and has held it long in peace and
without interruption, is at length regarded as its absolute owner, so that he can repel the old owner,
if he wishes later to reclaim it. The reason for the introduction of this right was partly that a man
who neglected for a long time to reclaim a thing was considered to have abandoned it, since in the
long interval it was thought that opportunities therefor could scarcely have been lacking; and partly
because the interests of peace and quiet required that possessions should finally be put beyond
controversy. And this especially because it seemed much more serious to be deprived of a thing
gamed in good faith after long possession, than to lack permanently a thing formerly lost, the desire
for which had been dissipated long ago. But in states peace and quiet require that certain periods he
defined, within which prescription may be completed, according as reason and the need of the state
suggest.


CHAPTER 13
On the Duties Which Result from Ownership Per Se


1. Out of the introduction of ownership these duties have come into being among men: in the first
place, that every man is bound to allow another (not a public enemy) to enjoy his possessions in
quiet, and not bring himself to injure them, make off with them, or appropriate them, by force or by
fraud. By this duty thefts, robberies, and similar crimes aimed at the property of others, are
forbidden.

2. In the second place, when a thing belonging to another has come into our hands without our guilt,
and with good faith on our part, and we still have it in our power, we are bound, so far as in us lies,
to bring about its return to the power of its legitimate owner. We are not, however, bound to restore
it at our expense, and if we have incurred any in order to keep it, we have a right to recover, or to
retain the thing until the expenses have been paid. And we are not actually bound to restore until we
are informed that the thing belongs to another. For then we are bound to report that the article is in
our possession, and that, so far as we are concerned, it is open to the owner to recover it. But if we
have acquired the thing by a just title, we are not ourselves bound to call the matter in doubt, and
as by a public proclamation to ask if anyone wishes to claim it as his own. And this duty outweighs
particular contracts, and allows an exception to them; for example, if a thief shall deposit stolen
goods with me unaware of the theft, and later the true owner appears, I shall be bound to restore the
property to him, not to the thief.

3. In the third place, if a thing belonging to another, acquired in good faith, has been consumed, it
is the part of duty to restore to the owner an amount equal to that by which we have been enriched,
that we may not gain by another's undeserved loss.

4. From these duties then the following conclusions are derived:
(1) A bona fide possessor is not bound to make any restitution, if the thing has perished, because he
has neither the thing itself, nor gain therefrom.

5. (2) A bona fide possessor is bound to restore not only the thing, but also the still existing fruits
of it. For naturally the owner of the thing is also owner of the fruits. But the possessor may subtract
all expenses incurred for the thing or its care, that the fruits might be obtained.

6. (3) A bona fide possessor is bound to restore the thing and the fruits that have been consumed,
provided he would otherwise have consumed as much, and can recover the value of the thing he is
obliged to restore from him of whom he received it. For in consuming another's property and sparing
his own he has enriched himself.

7. (4) A bona fide possessor is not bound to make good fruits which he has neglected. For he has
neither the thing, nor anything that has taken its place.

8. (5) If a bona fide possessor has had something belonging to another presented to him, and then
presents it to a third party, he is not bound, unless in any case he was going to make an equal gift
in consequence of some duty. For then it will be a gain to have spared his own property.

9. (6) If a bona fide possessor has for a real consideration acquired something belonging to another,
and has then alienated it in any way, he is not bound, except in so far as he has made gain out of it.

10. (7) A bona fide possessor is bound to restore another's property, even though acquired for a real
consideration, and cannot reclaim what he has spent from the owner, but only from the person from
whom he received the thing; except in case the owner could probably not have recovered possession
of his property without some expense, or has voluntarily offered a reward for information.

11. The finder of something which the owner was probably sorry to lose, cannot take it up with the
intention of withholding it from the owner when he comes to inquire. But when the owner does not
appear, the finder has a right to retain it for himself.


CHAPTER 14
On Value


1. After ownership had been introduced, and since all things were not of the same nature, and did
not yield the same service to human necessities, and no one had that abundance which he desired
for his needs, it soon became customary among men to exchange commodities. But it very often
happened that things of unlike nature or use had to be transferred, and hence, that one party or the
other might not suffer in this sort of exchange, it was necessary for human convention to assign
things a quantity, according to which they could be compared and balanced with one another. This
also was the case with actions, which men were unwilling to render for others' advantage for
nothing. This quantity usually goes by the name of value.

2. Value is divided into common value and value par excellence. The former is seen in things, and
actions or services, which enter into trade, in so far as they bring men some use and pleasure. The
latter is seen in money, in so far as it is understood virtually to contain the price of all things and
services, and to furnish them a common standard.

3. Of common value the foundation as such is that aptitude of the thing or the service, by which it
can contribute something directly or indirectly to the necessities of human life, and to make it more
comfortable or agreeable. Hence we usually call things that serve no use at all things of no value.
Yet there are some things most useful for human life, upon which things no definite value is
understood to have been set, either because they do not admit of ownership, and necessarily so, or
because they are unsuited for exchange, and hence withdrawn from trade, or because in trade they
are never considered otherwise than as an addition to something else. Moreover the law, human or
divine, in placing certain actions outside of trade, or forbidding one to perform them for hire, is
understood also to have deprived them of value. So too, inasmuch as the upper parts of the air, the
ether, and the heavenly bodies, and the vast ocean, are exempt from human ownership, no value can
be assigned to them either. Thus a free person has no value, because free men are not articles of
commerce. Thus sunlight, clear and pure air, the fair face of the earth, in so far as it merely feasts
the eyes, and wind, and shade, and the like, considered in and by themselves, have no value, since
men cannot enjoy such things without the use of the earth. Yet these very things are of great moment
in increasing or diminishing the value of regions, lands, and estates. So it is unlawful to set a price
upon sacred acts, to which a moral effect has been assigned by divine ordinance. This crime is called
simony. And a judge also commits a trine, if he sells justice.

4. Moreover, there are various reasons why the value of one and the same thing is increased or
diminished, and one thing even preferred to another, though the latter may seem to have an equal
or greater use in human life. For in this matter the necessity of the thing, or its exalted usefulness,
are so far from always holding the first place, that we rather see men hold in lowest esteem the
things with which human life cannot dispense. And this because nature, not without the singular
providence of God, pours forth a bountiful supply of them. Hence an increase of value tends to be
produced especially by scarcity; and this is made much of when things are brought from distant
parts. Hence love of display and luxury have placed enormous prices on many things with which
human life could very comfortably dispense, for instance pearls and jewels. But for articles in
everyday use prices are raised especially when their scarcity is combined with necessity or want. In
the case of artificial commodities, scarcity apart, the price is chiefly raised by the fineness and
elegance of the workmanship which they display, sometimes too by the fame of the artificer, also
the difficulty of the work, the scarcity of artisans and workmen, and so forth. As for services and
acts, difficulty enhances their price, as do also skill, utility, necessity, the scarcity or rank or freedom
of the agents, and finally even the reputation of the art, as being accounted noble or ignoble. The
opposites of these things usually lower the price. Finally, at times a certain thing is highly rated, not
by everybody, but by individuals, in consequence of a special affection, for example, because he
from whom it came to us is made much of by us, and the thing was given to express his affection;
or because we have grown accustomed to it, or it is a memorial of some great occurrence, or by its
aid we have avoided a great danger, or it was made by our own hands. This is called sentimental
value.

5. But in fixing the prices of single things, other matters too are usually considered. And among
those who live together in natural freedom the values of single commodities are defined only by
agreement of the contracting parties. For they are free to alienate or acquire what they please, and
have no common master to regulate their dealings. In states, on the other hand, prices are determined
in two ways: first, by decree of a superior, or by law; secondly, by the common estimate and
judgment of men, that is, the custom of the market, with the consent also of the contracting parties.
Some are in the habit of calling the former the legal price, the latter the common. When the legal
price has been established in favor of the buyers, which is the more usual case, the sellers are not
permitted to demand more. Yet, if they are willing to receive less, they are not forbidden to do so.
Thus when the wages of laborers have been officially rated in favor of those who hire, the laborer
may not demand more, but is not forbidden to receive less.

6. The common price, to be sure, not being fixed by law, admits a certain latitude, within which
more or less can be, and usually is, given and received, according as the contracting parties have
agreed. Generally, however, it follows the custom of the market. In this account is usually taken of
the labor and expense ordinarily incurred by merchants in transporting and handling their wares; also
of the manner of buying and selling, whether wholesale or retail. And sometimes the common price
is suddenly changed, according to the abundance or scarcity of purchasers, money, or wares. For
scarcity of purchasers and money (due to some special reason), and also abundance of wares,
diminish the price. On the other hand abundance of would-be-purchasers and of money, and scarcity
of wares, raise the price. So too it tends to lower the price, if wares seek a purchaser. On the contrary
the price is raised when the seller is actually besought, and will not sell otherwise. Finally this too
is usually considered, whether a man offers ready money, or puts off payment for a time; since time
also is a part of the price.

7. But after men departed from their primitive simplicity, and various kinds of gain were introduced,
it was readily understood that common value alone was not sufficient for the transaction of men's
affairs and their increasing dealings. For at that time dealings consisted in barter only, and the
services of others were not to be had except by an exchange of service, or by surrendering
something. But after we began to desire such a variety of things for convenience or pleasure, it
certainly was not easy for every man to possess the things which another would wish to exchange
for his own, or which were equal in value to the other's things. And in civilized states, where the
citizens are marked off into different classes, there must necessarily be several classes that would
be entirely unable to make a living, or scarcely able to do so, if the old-time simple exchange of
commodities and services were still in vogue. Hence most nations, attracted by a richer mode of life,
have seen fit by convention to impose a value par excellence upon a certain thing, in order that the
common values of the other things might be tested by this, and virtually contained in the same; so
that by this medium one could acquire anything that is for sale, and engage conveniently in any sort
of dealings and contracts.

8. For this purpose most nations have decided to employ the nobler and rarer metals. For they
possess a very compact substance, so as not to be worn away easily in use, and also they admit of
division into many small pieces. And they are no less convenient to keep and handle, while on
account of their rarity they can equal the value of many other things. Sometimes, however, from
necessity, and, among some nations, from lack of metals, other things have been employed in place
of coins.

9. Moreover, in states the right to define the value of a coin belongs to the highest authorities, and
hence official markings are usually impressed upon the coin. In this determination of value,
however, the general estimation of neighboring nations, or those with whom we have dealings, must
be considered. For otherwise, if a state should set an excessive valuation upon its coins, or not
properly alloy their material, it will put a serious check upon the commerce of its citizens with
foreigners, at least as regards all that cannot be settled by mere barter. And for this very reason no
rash change should be made in the value of coins, unless the extreme necessity of the state should
require it. But, with the increase of gold and silver, by degrees the value of coins decreases as it were
of itself, in comparison with the price of lands and anything depending thereon.


CHAPTER 15
On Contracts Which Presuppose the Prices
of Things, and the Duties Thence Derived


1. An agreement in general is the consent and convention of two or more persons to the same
purpose. But because frequently simple agreements are distinguished from contracts, the distinction
seems to consist particularly in this, that we give the name of contracts to any such agreements as
concern things or actions involved in trade, and hence presuppose ownership and prices. But such
conventions as are entered into concerning other matters, are denoted by the common term
agreements. And yet, to some of these the terms agreement and contract are indifferently applied.

2. Contracts can be divided into the gratuitous and the onerous. The former bring some advantage
gratis to one of the contracting parties, for example, a commission, a loan, a deposit; the latter bind
both parties to an equal burden, for in these something is furnished or given, with the intent that an
equivalent be received.

3. All onerous contracts, moreover, have this feature, that equality must be preserved in them, in
other words, that each of the contracting parties make an equal gain; and where an inequality arises,
the one who has received less acquires a right to demand that his lack be made good, or the contract
be broken off entirely. This, however, is particularly the case in states, where prices are fixed by the
usage of the market, or by law. But to find and determine this equality, it is required that the thing
which is the subject of contract, together with its qualities, if they arc of any importance here, be
known to both of the contracting parties. Hence also he who is to transfer something to another by
contract, must indicate not only its estimable qualities, but also a lack of the same, and defects. For
without this a just price cannot be settled. Yet such circumstances as do not in themselves affect the
thing, it is not necessary to indicate. And defects already known to both need not be indicated. And
he who knowingly acquires anything defective, has himself to blame.

4. Moreover in contracts of this kind equality must be so far maintained, that an inequality
discovered later must be corrected, even though there was no concealment, and no fault of the
contracting parties, for instance, because a fault was not noticed, or a mistake made in the price. And
something must be taken from him who has more, and given to him who has less. Yet in order to
avoid a mass of litigation, the civil laws give relief here in general only to very great injuries. For
the rest they bid each man look out for his own interests.

5. Gratuitous contracts are especially these three: commission, loan, and deposit. It is a commission
when one undertakes for nothing the management of another's affairs, when the latter requests it,
and intrusts the matter to the former. And this happens in two ways: so that the method of
management is either prescribed or left to his judgment and skill. In this contract one must conduct
himself with the highest honor and the greatest industry, since in general no one gives a commission
except to a friend, and one of whom he has a high opinion. And so, on the other side, the trustee
must be indemnified for expenses incurred in carrying out his commission, also for losses suffered
in consequence of the same, and properly resulting from the affair committed to his charge.

6. It is a loan when we grant another the use of something of ours for nothing. In this one must take
pains to keep and handle that same thing carefully and with the greatest diligence; and not apply it
to other uses, or further than the lender permitted; and restore it uninjured, and just as it was
received, except for what has been lost by ordinary use. But if it was loaned for a fixed time, and
meantime the owner begins to have great need of it, owing to some chance not foreseen at the time
of making the loan, it must, upon request, be restored to him, without subterfuge. If, however, the
thing lent has perished by some chance cause unforeseen, without any blame on the part of the
borrower, if it would have perished even in the possession of the owner, the estimated value need
not be paid. Otherwise it seems fair that the borrower should pay the estimated value, since the
owner would not have lost it, if he had not been generous toward the other. Vice versa, if any useful
or necessary expense has been incurred for the thing lent, aside from what regularly attends the use
of the thing, it must be refunded by the owner.

7. It is a deposit when we intrust to the honor of another a thing that is ours, or concerns us in some
way, that he may guard it for nothing. In this it is required that the thing intrusted be diligently
guarded, and restored whenever it pleases the depositor; unless restitution would be injurious to the
owner or others, and for that reason must be postponed. And it will not be permissible to use a thing
deposited, except with the consent of the owner, if indeed it would in any way be the worse for use,
or if it is to the owner's interest that it be not seen. And if a man has ventured to do so, he will make
good any risks incurred in the use of the thing. Also it is not permitted to take a thing deposited out
of the wrappings or receptacles, in which it was inclosed by the depositor. Moreover, it would be
a great disgrace and more shameful than theft, to deny a deposit; and it is far more disgraceful, to
deny a deposit of charity, that is, something deposited in view of the danger of fire, the fall of a
house, or a riot. On the other side, expenses incurred for a deposit must be refunded by the depositor.

8. Among the onerous contracts, about the most ancient, and that by which alone trading was carried
on before the invention of money, is barter, in which each side gives a thing for a thing of equal
value. Yet, even today, after the invention of money, there is a kind of barter particularly common
among merchants, by which commodities are not simply compared with each other, but first
appraised in money, and then turned over to their respective purchasers in place of money. But a
different transaction from the contract of barter is a reciprocal donation, in which it is not necessary
for equality to be observed.

9. Buying and selling is that by which, for a money consideration, ownership of a thing, or a right
equivalent thereto, is acquired. Its simplest form is when the price is first agreed upon, and then the
buyer at once offers and hands over the price, and the seller the commodity. Often, however, it is
agreed that the commodity shall be at once delivered, but that the price is to be paid after a certain
interval. Sometimes the price is agreed upon, but that the delivery of the property or commodity
shall take place after a certain time. In this it seems equitable that, before the expiration of that time,
the property be at the risk of the seller. But if the buyer should delay after the time has elapsed, and
not see to it that the property be delivered to him, it will henceforth be lost to the buyer. To the
contract of buying and selling various agreements-are commonly added; for example the provisional
sale, by which property is sold on such terms that the seller has the privilege of accepting a better
offer from another party, if made within a certain time. There is also the lex commissoria, when it
is agreed that, if at a certain date the price has not been paid, the property has not been bought. Also
the retractus, or an agreement to sell back again; which is so worded that if the price is not offered
within a certain rime, or at all, the buyer is bound to restore the property to the seller. Or the
agreement may be that, if the property is offered to him, the seller shall be bound to restore the price;
or that, if the buyer is going to sell again of his own motion, the former seller shall have precedence
over all others in purchasing; and this is also called the right of refusal. So too, it is common for the
seller to reserve a certain part of an estate he has sold, or a certain use of that part. There is another
kind of purchase which they call per aversionem, when many things of unequal value are appraised
not singly, but valued and bought at haphazard and in the lump. In that form of sale which we call
auction, the thing is at last knocked down to that one of several bidders who has offered the most.
Finally, there is a kind of purchase in which no definite thing is bought, but merely a probable hope.
In this some hazard is involved, so that neither the buyer should complain, if the hope disappoints
him, nor the seller, if it goes far beyond.

10. Letting and hiring is a contract by which the use of a thing, or services, are assigned to a man
for pay. In this, while it is regularly customary to agree in advance upon the payment, still, if a man
has assigned to another his services or the use of his property, without previous determination of the
price, he is understood to expect as much as comports with common usage and the equity of him
who hires. With regard to this contract, it is to be observed that, if the thing let has perished utterly,
the person who hires is henceforth no longer held for payment or rent. But if the thing let has a
certain and definite use, the owner is bound to guarantee its fitness for that use; and correspondingly,
if it suffers any damage, the hirer subtracts from his rent in proportion to the diminished usefulness
of the thing. But if the property let has an uncertain yield, and contains an element of chance, an
abundant crop is so much gain for the lessee, and in the same way a bad crop is his loss. And in strict
law nothing is to be subtracted from the rent on account of that leanness, especially since the
leanness of one year is usually balanced by the fatness of the next. Exception is made if the accidents
which robbed him of his crop are very rare, and if the lessee is presumed not to have thought of
taking that risk upon himself. For it is certainly fair that such accidents should have the effect of
diminishing or remitting the rent. But just as the lessor is bound to put the thing itself into usable
condition, and assume the necessary expenses, so the lessee must use it as a good householder, and
restore whatever has been lost by his own fault. And he who has engaged to have some work done
for him, makes it good in the same way, if the matter is spoiled by his own fault. If a man has let out
to another his temporary services, and by any chance has been prevented from performing the same,
he cannot claim his wages. But if one has hired the continuous services of another, and the man has
become useless for service for a moderate length of time, owing to illness or other chance, it is
inhuman for one either to remove him entirely from his situation, or to deduct from his
compensation.

11. In the contract of mutuum, a replaceable thing is given to a man, on the understanding that after
an interval he is to return the same kind in the same quantity and quality. And the things usually
given in loan are called replaceable, i.e., admitting of being replaced in their kind, because anything
of that kind can assume the role of another, so that, if one has received of the same kind, quantity,
and quality, he is said to have received what he gave. Also, the same things are determined and
specified by weight, number, and measure, from which point of view they are also commonly called
quantities, as distinguished from specific commodities. A loan is made moreover, either gratis, so
that no more is received than was given, or else with some profit, which is called interest. And this
is not repugnant to natural law, if indeed it be moderate, and in proportion to the gain which the
other makes out of the money, or other loan, and to my loss, or cessation of profit, incurred by the
absence of my property. Also if it be not exacted from the poor, for whom a loan takes the place of
alms.

12. In the contract of partnership two or more persons contribute their money, property, or services
to this end, that the resulting profits may be divided pro rata among them all; and that, if any loss
is incurred, this in the same way is to be borne pro rata by each of them. In this partnership it is a
duty to show honor and industry; and likewise one must not withdraw prematurely from the same
to the detriment of a partner. But once the partnership has been dissolved, after subtraction of profit
and loss, each receives as much as he put in. But in case one contributed money or property, the
other services, we must consider the manner of that contribution. For, when the services of the one
have to do only with handling the other's money or property, or selling for him, their shares in the
profits are determined by the relation between the profit on the money, or property, and the value
of the labor, and the safety or loss of the capital concerns only him who contributed it. But when the
labor is spent upon the improvement of something contributed by the other, the first is understood
to have a share in the thing also, in proportion to the extent of the improvement. But when men have
entered into a partnership of their entire property, the several partners must faithfully contribute
what they gain, and conversely they are supported out of the common stock, each according to his
condition. But should the partnership be dissolved, the division of property would be in proportion
to what each brought into the partnership in the beginning; and no questions are asked as to whose
property produced the gain or loss to the partnership, unless it was otherwise agreed.

13. There are also a number of contracts which involve chance Among these one may number
wagers, in which one affirms, and the other denies, the truth of some event not yet known to either,
and a certain sum is deposited on each side, to fall to that one with whose statement the event is
found to agree. Here belong all kinds of games, in which there is competition for a prize. Among
these, however, less hazard belongs to those which include a contest of wits, skill, adroitness, or
strength. In some of them wits and chance display equal force. In others finally chance
predominates. And it is incumbent upon the rulers of a state to consider how far the toleration of
contracts of this sort is of advantage to the state or individuals. To this class belongs the raffle, i.e.,
when a number of persons buy something by a common contribution, and then decide by lot so
which one of them the thing is to fall entire. Also the pot of fortune, or lottery, i.e., when a certain
number of lots or small sheets, inscribed and blank, are thrown into an urn, and then one buys the
privilege of drawing them out, so that he who does so receives that thing which the inscription
names. Related to these contracts is insurance, or the contract of avoiding a risk and making the
same good, by which a man, upon the receipt of a certain sum, takes upon himself and insures the
risk which wares to be transported to other places are going to run, so that, if these happen to be lost,
the insurer is bound to restore their value to the owner.

14. For the greater solidity and security of contracts sureties and pledges are frequently added. In
the case of a surety, another man. who is thought suitable by the creditor, takes upon himself, as a
kind of reserve, the obligation of the principal debtor, so that, if the latter does not pay, the other
takes his place, with the understanding, however, that what he has spent must be refunded to him
by the principal debtor. But, though the surety cannot be held to a larger sum than the principal
debtor, it is not unreasonable for the former to be held more strictly to account than the latter, since
more confidence was had in him than in the other. But naturally the principal debtor is to be called
upon before the surety, unless the latter has taken the other's obligation entirely upon himself, in
which case he is called an expromissor. But if several have become sureties for one man, each is to
be called upon merely pro rata; unless one of them happens to be insolvent, or there is no
opportunity to call upon him. For in that case the others will be burdened with his share.

15. Again, for the security of a loan, the creditor often has the debtor give or assign him some thing,
called a pledge or mortgage, until the debt has been paid. The object of this is not only that the
debtor may be urged to payment by the desire to recover his property, but also that the creditor may
have at hand a source of payment. And for that reason pledges are regularly of a value equal to the
debt itself, or greater. But the objects which are pledged are either productive or unproductive. With
regard to the former, it is common to add the contract of reciprocal usage, i.e., that the creditor may
gather the fruits of the pledge, in place of interest. With regard to the latter, the lex commissoria is
added, namely that the pledge is to fall to the creditor, if payment has not been made within a certain
time. And this is naturally not unfair, when the pledge is not more valuable than the debt, plus the
interest for the interval, or when it does exceed, the excess is restored to the owner. But, as the
creditor must restore the pledge after payment, so in the meantime he is bound to take no less care
of it than of his own possessions. And when there has been no contract of reciprocal usage, and the
thing is of a kind to be worn out by use, or if the debtor's interests are in any way involved, the
creditor cannot use the thing without his consent. A mortgage differs from a pledge in this, that the
latter is constituted by delivery of the thing, while the former, as the thing is not delivered, consists
in the bare assignment of something, especially something immovable, from which, in case of
non-payment, the creditor can recover his loan.

16. What are the duties of contracting parties, however, is entirely clear from the purpose and nature
of these contracts.


CHAPTER 16
The Methods of Dissolving Obligations Arising from Agreements


1. Among the methods of dissolving obligations arising from agreements, and so of terminating the
duties thence derived, the most natural is the fulfillment or payment of that in regard to which the
agreement was made. Regularly it is the debtor who is bound to pay; but, if the amount is furnished
by another in the name of the contractor of the obligation, this last is dissolved; provided it does not
otherwise make a difference, by whom fulfillment is made. If, however, one pays for another with
no intention to make him a present, one can recover from him the amount expended. Moreover,
payment must be made to the creditor, or to a person whom he has delegated to receive the debt in
his name. And finally one must perform or pay the very thing agreed upon (not something else in
its place), entire, not mutilated, not a mere part, not divided, and at the place and time agreed upon.
Yet the consideration of the creditor or the inability of the debtor may compel the former to put off
the date of payment, or to split the amount into instalments, or even to accept one thing for another.

2. Obligations are also brought to an end by compensation, which is a balancing of credit and debit,
that is, when a debtor is freed because the creditor himself evidently owes him something of the
same kind and value. For, inasmuch as equality is identity, especially in things that are replaceable,
and since, if the debt is mutual, I must immediately return the same amount that I have Just received,
therefore, in order to avoid useless payments, it is most convenient for each to make payment by
retaining his own. It is evident, moreover, that compensation can be applied properly to replaceable
things of the same sort, the time for whose payment is present or past; but not to other things, or
performances of a different nature, unless they are both reduced to an estimate of their value, that
is, to money.

3. An obligation is further terminated by release or remission on the part of him to whom the debt
was due, and whose interest it was to have the obligation fulfilled. This is brought about either
expressly, by giving signs that indicate consent, for example, a fictitious acknowledgment, restoring
or destroying the papers; or else tacitly, as when one himself hinders the payment of the debt, or is
responsible for such hindrance.

4. Obligations consisting in a performance on both sides are also commonly dissolved by mutual
dissent, if nothing has yet been done, unless positive laws forbid. But when something has already
been performed by the one party, a release must be given by him, or there must be some other
adjustment.

5. Moreover, an obligation is not so much dissolved as broken off by the treachery of one party or
the other. For when one does not perform what was agreed, the other is not bound to perform what
he undertook in view of such performance. For in agreements the items of things to be performed
are implied as a condition in the subsequent items, as if one had said, "I shall perform this, if you
first perform that."

6. Obligations also expire when the status, upon which alone they depended at the time, has been
changed either by him who was bound to perform, or by him to whom performance was due.

7. By time itself obligations expire, if their duration was dependent upon some point of time, unless
that duration shall have been extended by express or tacit agreement of the parties. But the power
to demand fulfillment of the obligation must have existed during that period.

8. Finally, obligations which have their roots in a man's person are dissolved by death. For the
subject having been taken away, the accidents also must be extinguished. But often an obligation
is continued in the survivors of deceased persons, and this either because the survivor out of pious
duty, or for other reasons, has taken upon himself to fulfill the obligations of the deceased; or else
because the obligation must be satisfied out of the possessions of the deceased, which have passed
with that burden to the heir.

9. By substitution, one presents, with the consent of the creditor, one's own debtor, that he may pay
the debt instead of one's self. In this indeed the creditor's consent is required, but not that of that
third person, whom I can assign, even without his knowledge and consent, to the other, if he is
willing. For it makes no difference to which of the two one pays, but a great difference from whom
one demands the payment of a debt.


CHAPTER 17
On Interpretation


1. It is indeed true that in matters enjoined by authority, a man is not bound beyond the intention of
that authority, and that in matters to which he elects to bind himself, he is not bound beyond what
was his own intention. And yet as one cannot judge of another's intention, except from actions and
signs that impress the senses, a man is consequently considered in a human court as bound only to
that which a sound interpretation of those indications suggests. Hence, for a right understanding of
laws, as well as of agreements, and for the performance of the duty involved, it is of the greatest
importance to establish rules of sound interpretation, for words especially, as the commonest sign.

2. With regard to ordinary terms this is the rule: words are regularly to be interpreted in their proper
and well-known signification, imposed upon them not so much by propriety or grammatical analogy
or consistency with derivation, as by popular usage,
"to whom belongs The rule, the law, the government of tongues."

3. Terms of the arts are to be explained according to the definitions of men versed in the particular
art. But if technical terms are differently defined by different persons, expressing in ordinary terms
what we mean by the other word makes for the prevention of suits.
4. Conjectures too are needed, to draw out the real meaning, if either single words or a group of
words are ambiguous; or if some parts of a discourse seem to contradict each other, yet so that by
applying a skillful explanation they can be reconciled. Where the contradiction is certain and
evident, the later statement will annul the earlier ones.
[Text is missing]
according to the subject-matter. For the speaker is always presumed to have in view the matter of
which he was speaking; and hence the meaning of his words is always to be adapted to the same.

6. As for the effect and consequences, this is the rule: when words, simply and literally taken, would
entail either no effect, or an absurd one, there must be a slight departure from the commonly
received meaning, in so far as the necessity of avoiding the meaningless or the absurd requires.

7. From related statements are derived the strongest conjectures; for a man is presumed to be
consistent. Statements are related, locally speaking, or merely as regards their origin. For the former
this is the rule: if in some passage of the same discourse the meaning has been plainly and clearly
expressed, obscurer wordings are to be interpreted by the plain expressions. Related to this is
another rule: in the accurate interpretation of every discourse one must give attention to the
preceding and following statements, to which the intervening are presumed to adapt themselves and
correspond. For the latter kind of statement this rule is observed: an obscure expression of one and
the same man is to be interpreted by his own clearer expressions, though manifested at a different
time and place; unless it is quite plain that he has changed his mind.

8. It is also of the greatest advantage to a search for the true meaning, particularly in the case of
laws, to examine the reason for the law, or that cause and consideration which moved the lawgiver
to make this law, especially when it is evident that this was the one reason for the law. For this we
have the rule: the interpretation of a law which agrees with the reason for its passage must be
followed, and that which differs from the same must in turn be rejected. Also, when the one adequate
reason for a law ceases, the law itself ceases. But when there were several reasons for the same law,
it does not at once cease entirely with one of these, since the remaining reasons may suffice to
sustain the force of the law. Often, too, the mere will of the lawgiver is sufficient, though the reason
for the law may be unknown.

9. We must observe, besides, that many words have more than one signification, a looser, and a
stricter sense: also that the content is now favorable, now invidious, now indifferent. The favorable
is that which makes equal terms for both parties, or regards the common advantage, or maintains any
formal acts, or promotes peace, etc. Invidious is whatever burdens one party only, or one more than
the other, or carries with it a penalty, or nullifies an act, or changes existing conditions, or promotes
war. Indifferent is, for example, anything that does indeed change existing conditions, but in the
interest of peace. For these this is the rule: the favorable is to be interpreted more broadly, the
invidious more strictly.

10. From other sources than words there are also conjectures, which have this effect, that an
interpretation is sometimes to be broadened, sometimes to be narrowed. Yet one may more easily
find reasons which persuade one to narrow an interpretation, than to enlarge it. The law, then, can
be extended to a case not mentioned in it, if it is established that a reason which fits the present case
was the only one which influenced the lawgiver, and was considered by him in its general bearing,
and in such a way as to include similar cases as well. A law must also be extended to meet those
cases which are devised by the evil ingenuity of men, in order to outwit the law.

11. On the other hand, the restriction of words expressed in general terms occurs either from an
original defect of intention, or from a conflict between a case that arises and the intention. That a
man is presumed not to have desired a thing from the beginning is understood (1) from an absurdity
which would otherwise follow; and this no man of sound mind is thought to have desired. Hence
general terms are to be restricted, in so far as otherwise an absurdity would result from them. (2)
From the absence of that reason which alone prompted the man's will. Hence, under a general
expression, cases with which the one adequate reason for the law does not square, are not included.
(3) From the absence of the subject-matter, which the speaker is always thought to have had in mind.
Hence general terms are always to be adapted to that same matter.

12. But the fact that a case subsequently arising conflicts with the intention of him who made some
disposition, is discovered either from the natural reason, or from some sign of his intention. The
former happens, if a departure from equity would be unavoidable, unless certain cases were excepted
from the general law. For equity is the correction of that in which the law fails on account of its
universality. For since not all cases can be foreseen, or stated, on account of their infinite variety,
therefore, when general terms are to be applied to special cases, we must except those cases which
the lawgiver would have excepted, if he had been consulted in regard to such a case. But it is not
permitted to have recourse to this equity, unless sufficient indications compel us so to do. The most
certain of these is this: if it should appear, that the natural law would be violated, in case one wished
to follow strictly the letter of the human law. Next in importance: if it be not indeed unlawful to
follow the letter of the law, but still, in a humane view of the matter, it seem too severe and
intolerable, whether for all men in general, or for certain persons; or if the end appear not worth
buying at so high a price.

13. Finally, exception must be made to a general expression, if words found elsewhere do not indeed
directly conflict with the present law or agreement, but on account of a certain element in the
situation cannot be observed at the same time, here and now. Here, then, there are certain rules to
be observed, so that we can understand what law ought to be preferred, in case both cannot at the
same time be satisfied: (1) What is merely permitted, gives way to what is commanded. (2) What
must be done at a certain time, is preferred to what can be done at any time. (3) An affirmative
precept gives way to a negative. Or when an affirmative precept cannot be met, without violating
the negative, the fulfillment of the former must be omitted for the present. (4) As between
conventions and laws otherwise equal, the special is preferred to the general. (5) As between two
performances, which at a particular moment conflict, one of them having more honorable or useful
reasons than the other, it is proper for the latter to give way to the former. (6) An agreement without
oath yields to one with an oath, when both cannot be satisfied at the same time. (7) An imperfect
obligation yields to the perfect. (8) The law of beneficence, other things being equal, yields to the
law of gratitude.
